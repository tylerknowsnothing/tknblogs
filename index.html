<p>#writing  â¢ Someone on the internet I have never met just poked me. So hard that it hurt. Her name is Liz and I forgive her because she didn&rsquo;t poke me personally. I might even liken it to jabbing myself, and all because she defined the word &ldquo;enough&rdquo; in my context.</p>
<p>In January of 2020, two months before it would have a name, my little family of three caught Covid-19. While we didn&rsquo;t experience any respiratory complications or need hospitalization, it was painful and exhausting, and I was dealing with a bout of Shingles at the same time. My right hip, thigh, and lower back have never recovered and still feel slightly numb. I blame the Covid.</p>
<p>Well, more precisely, I blame Long Covid. My particular variety includes brain fog, exhaustion, constipation, dry mouth, diminished taste and smell, and what&rsquo;s been termed by some as Post Exertion Malaise. I&rsquo;ve also been dealing with a cavalcade of musculoskeletal issues, mostly due to a motorcycle accident I had in 1990.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had my left knee replaced and will need to get the right one replaced at some point, a cervical spinal fusion, will probably need to get one of my arm bones shortened to alleviate wrist pain, and have been dealing with Degenerative Disc Disease since I was 19. Oh, and the arthritis, near non-stop tinnitus, and sciatica down both legs. I have a feeling I&rsquo;m forgetting some things, but this is enough.</p>
<p>In short, loads of fun.</p>
<p>All of these issues have had a significant impact on my ability to write. Writing is what I&rsquo;ve done professionally and as a blogger since 1996, with about twenty of those years in the computer book publishing industry where I contributed to about one hundred books. I started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020802055015/http://www.pdahandyman.com:80/">PDA Handyman in 2002</a> and ran that blog for about eight years, as well. I&rsquo;ve written hundreds of blog posts, many I&rsquo;ve lost over time due to moving servers and being dumb, and some of which I still host here on my website.</p>
<p>Writing has been a part of my essence since I decided I wanted to be a writer when I was nine, and while it took many years for me to realize that dream, it has always been an endeavor filled with pain and joy&hellip; which is where Liz comes on. In her short, concise post on <a href="https://writerunboxed.com/2025/01/24/enough/">Writer Unboxed entitled &ldquo;Enough&rdquo;</a> she managed to poke me with a sharp stick and draw emotional blood. She didn&rsquo;t do it on purpose. She has no idea who I am. She simply related her experience, like a good writer. (You should read her post now. It&rsquo;ll be quick.)</p>
<p>But it hurt nonetheless. Maybe even more, since she was again able to find joy in writing. I, on the other hand, feel lost, like I might never again recover those aspects of writing that at once brought me happiness and the satisfaction of having accomplished something through the adversity of putting down words on a page. Creation, after all, is pain, but it&rsquo;s more than that. It&rsquo;s about all of the emotions, the good and the bad, that swirl around the process.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t focus. I have never had good memory recall, but in the past few years it&rsquo;s gotten significantly worse. I have days where my various sources of pain are just too intense. Following a terrible experience with opioids after my knee replacement, I haven&rsquo;t used them since, so all I have for pain relief are ibuprofen, pregabalin, and tylenol. As I go into my second day trying to complete this post my tinnitus is at a 9/10. It could be infuriating, but I&rsquo;ve been dealing with it for so long now I&rsquo;ve gotten used to it. That doesn&rsquo;t make it easier to manage, but I don&rsquo;t get mad about it much any more.</p>
<p>I used to have ideas just pop into my head all the time. That&rsquo;s mostly gone now. And yet, despite all these challenges, I still try. And that&rsquo;s when I realized that what Liz was saying about &ldquo;enough&rdquo; is what I&rsquo;ve been doing. I post about nerdy news and animation and comics I like and some politics here and there, but I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed sharing what I&rsquo;m #NowPlaying as one of my deepest loves is for music.</p>
<p>So maybe you are right, Liz. As a writer, it just has to be enough, I think. At least for now.</p>

			 <p>Don&rsquo;t watch the news today since all they&rsquo;ll be talking about is how great and normal it is to just hand an entire country over to a criminal in the name of a democracy that&rsquo;s been utterly broken and shreaded. If that leaves you unsure of what to do instead, here are some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen to some music. I&rsquo;ve been sharing my album plays, and here&rsquo;s a list of them that I refresh a few times a week. <a href="https://tylerknowsnothing.com/nothing-manor-jukebox/">tylerknowsnothing.com/nothing-m&hellip;</a></li>
<li>Go for a walk</li>
<li>Spend time with friends</li>
<li>Play a game like a board game, video games, or get into table-top role-playing games (TTRPG), or even just a few dozen rounds of poker</li>
<li>Read a book like Isaac Asimov&rsquo;s Robot series, many of which are murder mysteries. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_series">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robo&hellip;</a></li>
<li>Nap in a patch of sunlight or next to a warming fire with your kids and/or pets</li>
<li>Bake something like biscuits or pie or some nice, big potatoes and stuff them with cheese, bacon, sour cream, and chives, or whatever you like</li>
<li>Help out at your local homeless shelter or donate some old clothes to families in need</li>
<li>If you can afford it, slap a few hundred bucks on a gift card, go to that store, and pay for everyone until it runs out</li>
<li>Stop and smell some roses</li>
<li>Watch a movie or three like The Wild Robot (2024 on Apple TV, Google Play, Amazon Prime and more)</li>
<li>Write something nice on a pad of paper about nice and/or hopeful for yourself or someone you like</li>
<li>Get out an old computer and install Linux Mint and engage in some joyful technological discovery. <a href="https://linuxmint.com">linuxmint.com</a></li>
<li>Go out on a thrift shop crawl in your local area and buy some old things to give them a new home</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you must watch TV, then allow me to suggest one of the single most joyful and affirming shows ever made;l Netflix&rsquo;s <em>Somebody Feed Phil</em>. You will not regret it. Well, you&rsquo;ll regret having trouble eating the food Phil eats, unless you live in one of the cities he&rsquo;s covered.</p>
<p>Feel free to submit your own lists of things to do other than watch the news today. #animation #comics #manga #film #movies #linux #music #retrocomputing #humanrights #civilrights #scifi #tech #videogames #writing</p>

<p>#journalism #dollarnomics #editorial - Tyler K. Nothing reporting.</p>
<p>DATELINE INTERNETOPIA - #Substack has created a mythology in the form of the $15 a month newsletter. The claim was that it would help support independent writers who have been driven out of organized news gathering by capitalist greed&rsquo;s desire to &ldquo;trim the fat&rdquo; (meaning people who cost money they&rsquo;d rather have in their Cayman bank accounts), but the model is unsustainable. In reality, all it does is net Substack more revenue.</p>
<p>Of course, they need that larger cut to support the now far more bloated model that appears to include completely free hosting of a blog, unless you want to use your custom domain, and then you&rsquo;ll have to cough up $50&hellip; and then do it yourself. Yeah. You pay them to then do all the legwork. Liberating, indeed.</p>
<p>Whinging about fees nobody else charges aside, most newsletters are asking for $15 every single month. That doesn&rsquo;t get you an entire newspapers worth of content, but the words of one contributor. And Substack doesn&rsquo;t offer discounts for subscribing to multiple newsletters, so if you pay for three newsletters you will be forking over $45 a month.</p>
<p>That comes to $540 a year which is more than double what we pay annually to heat our water and dry our clothes. Imagine floating an entire newspaper&rsquo;s bullpen at those rates so one person could stay up-to-date with the news! Not that I would, but I can get a <a href="https://checkout.pasadenastarnews.com/">subscription to the Pasadena Star-News for $3.50 a week</a>. That&rsquo;s an actual newspaper with lots of contributors, sections, resources, and whatnot and it&rsquo;s still a buck less a month than that single newsletter.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do this. It won&rsquo;t work. We cannot continue to rely on insanely wealthy oligarchs owning all of our local and national news, whose collective bias against a free press has become increasingly clear over the past few years, to transmit that bias into our consciousness on a daily basis.</p>
<p>If there is one thing we can do as, and I&rsquo;ll use the word yet again, a collective, it is to subscribe to an organic virtual bullpen of writers to produce open source news that everyone could benefit from, regardless of how deep (or shallow) their pockets are. Several such collectives would be even better. And let&rsquo;s start it at $5 a month with a sliding scale so readers can select a contribution they can afford.</p>
<p>The mainstream media, popularly known as the MSM in various circles, and the internet as a whole, has been slowly and methodically subsumed by the rich and powerful and turned into outlets for their increasingly unhinged desires to terraform society into something better suited to their wants and needs.</p>
<p>Look no further than Elon Musk&rsquo;s acquisition of Twitter and its rapid descent into madness. More recently Mark Zuckerberg has announced the end of fact checking on Facebook and other Meta platforms for reasons that are plainly disingenuous. X is much smaller than Facebook, but Facebook and Instagram represents 5 BILLION USERS.</p>
<p>If Mark is able to influence a mere 1% of his global userbase, that&rsquo;s 50 MILLION people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just insane.</p>
<p>A solution requires two parties, creators and readers. We have the creators, but readers need to step up and be willing to pay a small monthly fee knowing that it will go towards the production of quality, reliable, fact-checked news gathering. Getting everything on the internet for free is a zombie shambling around a china shop, smashing everything and making a chaotic mess of things and we need to put it down, for good.</p>
<p>After all, you get what you pay for.</p>

			 <p>First, watch the linked video to get the scope of the leaks so far, if you haven&rsquo;t been tracking them already: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jCwJ80rfRY">www.youtube.com/watch</a> #videogames #nintendo #switch2 #leaks</p>
<p>If that is a PLUS button on the tablet side, that &ldquo;button&rdquo; looking thing on the top of the S2 Joycon could just be a lever to actuate it when the Joycon is connected. There may be added functionality for using the tablet without the Joycons which the PLUS and MINUS buttons could facilitate.</p>
<p>The ovoid next to the right shoulder button could just be a cover for an access screw. Another leaker mentioned that the shoulder buttons were the actual magnets? If so, then the slot/tab arrangement is likely a physical connector.</p>
<p>As for the source of the leaks, it could be Nintendo themselves who have authorized or sanctioned or even provided the leaks to the &ldquo;leakers&rdquo;, considering it&rsquo;s been getting loads of press coverage leading up to CES next week.</p>
<p>They could be taking the tack that since everyone already knows about it, why not leak the hardware in bits and pieces, let peeps speculate as much as they like, and drive the 24/7 news cycle. It would certainly be an interesting marketing scheme that has, so far, cost them nothing.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, whenever that is, it&rsquo;s going to be interesting on a number of levels. There are plenty of specifics remaining for Nintendo to clarify. I personally don&rsquo;t think that this coverage or these leaks have hurt them. They&rsquo;ve only helped them. The transition to a new console is typically a minefield for console makers. Just ask Microsoft about their botched Xbox One roll out.</p>
<p>The Switch is the 3rd best selling video game console of all time, so far, with 146 million units at last reporting. In 2nd place is their own DS portable with 154 million. In first place is Sony with the Playstation 2, meaning Nintendo is essentially first among modern consoles, as Sony&rsquo;s Playstation 4 still wasn&rsquo;t able to beat the 4th place finisher, Nintendo&rsquo;s Game Boy and Game Boy Color handhelds. (SOURCE: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just have to wait and see, won&rsquo;t we.</p>

<p>I realized yesterday whilst doing a little research that I&rsquo;d been leaving out the Jazz Fusion genre as a tag and only using the Progressive Jazz tag, which not everyone will recognize. I&rsquo;ve now rectified that error :) This is my second favorite Simon Phillips album, though I do adore the Protocol projects, Midair Decision and Biplane to Bermuda being my two favorite tracks. My favorite remains 1999&rsquo;s Out of The Blue, however, with its more kinetic take on Midair Decision. I&rsquo;ll be playing that next :)</p>

<p>That sour, disappointed look flooded onto my wife&rsquo;s face. She was upset. I asked her what was wrong, and she explained to me that her Wordpress stats weren&rsquo;t working like they used to. I poked around and couldn&rsquo;t find anything obviously amiss in the Jetpack plugin settings, so I told her it was likely a glitch and would clear up. About a week later I got the email.</p>
<p>Wordpress had determined that my wife&rsquo;s social justice and political analysis blog (<a href="https://rimaregas.com">https://rimaregas.com</a>) was now deemed a commercial website and that she&rsquo;d need to pay up in order to continue getting the vital stats she needs to run her site. It is important to note here that we don&rsquo;t use Wordpress hosting, but Name.com website hosting, so her Wordpress installation is effectively self-hosted, and self-hosted sites have, for many years, been free of the capitalism of the official Wordpress hosting platform run by Automattic.</p>
<p>And how, you might ask, did they determine that the blog was now considered &ldquo;commercial&rdquo;? By asking for donations&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Automattic has been shifting the goal posts and clearly want to start milking the self-hosting crowd after spending more than a decade making Jetpack a vital component in almost any Wordpress installation, especially for small bloggers. We didn&rsquo;t need any of the paid upgrades and the free services offered were more than sufficient. Rima preferred to remain on the blogging platform she&rsquo;d become accustomed to, but this thing with the stats was the final straw. So, she decided to migrate away from Wordpress and selected Substack, the popular newsletter self-publishing tool that has grown into a blogging platform of its own, as her new platform.</p>
<p>I looked over everything. I combed through the settings and documentation to understand how everything worked and to verify a wide range of items like compatibility with Wordpress post imports and migrating her list of subscribers. One feature I even checked was if Substack had the ability to assign her domain name to her blog, and I was pleased to discover that indeed it did. I worked through the various tasks of getting everything configured for her and to essentially become a mirror of her Wordpress website which, after setting up the aforementioned custom domain with our DNS registrar, would be shut down.</p>
<p>In retrospect I&rsquo;d made one critical mistake, however&hellip; I&rsquo;d never clicked the link to setup the custom domain.</p>
<p>In all the years I&rsquo;ve been blogging and working with Wordpress and setting up websites and whatnot I have never once come across what I saw in the image at the top of this post. I&rsquo;ve seen far lower prices (around $5-10) and even annual fees, but these have always been for commercial systems designed for corporations, and you always expect that kind of chicanery in the enterprise realm, but not on the consumer internet. I&rsquo;m not a networking guru or anything like that, but I do know that setting DNS (Domain Name Services) to point one address at another address is, in short, a zero cost proposition.</p>
<p>The anger that welled up in me at the thought of having to pay $50 for an automated process that requires no technician involvement and what amounts to a tiny change in a text file on my registrars DNS server which is then propagated to other DNS servers (99.9% of which are not run by Substack) across the entire internet was profound. In fact, I am the one who does all the work, so I&rsquo;m paying Substack $50 and then doing the work myself? The concept is literally insane. There is no reality in which Substack&rsquo;s DNS servers are overburdened by custom domain name configurations. Period.</p>
<p>But Rima had already committed and we weren&rsquo;t going to turn back, so we haven&rsquo;t, but we also haven&rsquo;t dropped half a C-note for the privilege of getting to use the domain name we own on her blog. $50 is precious to us, but we will find a time at which we can do it. It just rankles that Substack has chosen to make free revenue from a service that isn&rsquo;t even their own and costs them nothing to implement.</p>
<p>Caveat emptor, I guess.</p>

Despite getting the Grammy nomination for best Rock Gospel Album of 1997 (the version I&rsquo;m playing is a re-issue) there&rsquo;s very little overt religiosity unless you dig into the lyrics. It&rsquo;s a solid progressive pop rock album with lots of clever hooks and arrangements. #music #nowplaying</p>

			 <p>Now Playing @ Nothing Manor: Mr. Mister - Pull (2010).

It took frontman Richard Page two decades to regain the rights to the album, finish the mix, and release it under his own label. I had a bootleg copy of the leaked album, bought it when it came out, and now listen to this expanded edition. It remains one of my favorite albums. #music #nowplaying</p>

			 <p>#GPD is about to roll out their new Pocket 4 micro laptop and it&rsquo;s gotten a significant upgrade. It now features an #AMD #Ryzen AI 9 HX370 CPU with a #Radeon 890M iGPU and an 8.8&quot; 2560x1600 144Hz display. It has 40Gbps Thunderbolt 4 and a swappable port module on the back, as well. It&rsquo;s more for admins than for gaming but it&rsquo;s rather versatile and can even run #linux. Very slick little devices! #tech <a href="https://youtu.be/FWo4xElfKgE">youtu.be/FWo4xElfK&hellip;</a></p>

			 <p>Well, this is interesting. Does the name D.B. Cooper ring a bell? It should, as that&rsquo;s the nom de plume of the only air pirate case that has never been solved. 57 years ago today, he jumped out of a commercial jet with a parachute and $200,000 and has, so far, gotten away scot free. It&rsquo;s seems now, however, that they might have their first new evidence since they soft-closed the case in 2016. #crime #airpirates #airlines #robbery #dbcooper <a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/24/11/24/1815217/is-there-new-evidence-in-the-db-cooper-case">yro.slashdot.org/story/24/&hellip;</a></p>

Apparently 80% of that is going to the #animation wizards at French studio #Fortiche, and the price tag is in service to the art and paying artists what they deserve.

<p>What can I say about <em>Watchmen</em> that hasn&rsquo;t already been said&hellip; is what I would say if DC hadn&rsquo;t just released the first part of an animated two part adaptation of what is considered one of the finest comic books of all time. But let&rsquo;s talk about the comic book first.</p>
<p>Released as a 12-issue limited series in 1986 and rendered into a trade paperback combining all twelve issues in 1987, the creation of writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons, and colored by John Higgins, <em>Watchmen</em> was a critical and commercial success and has remained so since its release. It would win a <a href="https://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1988-hugo-awards/">Hugo Award in 1988</a> and be added to <a href="https://entertainment.time.com/2005/10/16/all-time-100-novels/slide/all/">Time Magazine&rsquo;s 100 All-Time Best Novels list</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For more details regarding the Watchmen comics, please refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen">Wikipedia entry</a>.</strong></em></p>

</div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(film)">Zack Snyder&rsquo;s 2009 adaptation</a> was something of a critical success, but in no way a commercial one. On a $150 million dollar budget it only pulled in $187 million at the box office, or in other words a commercial flop. A Director&rsquo;s Cut would be released later in 2009, but that would only increase the film&rsquo;s appreciation amongst critics and would not contribute to the studioâs bottom line in any significant way. A decade later, HBO would release <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(TV_series)">Damon Lindelof&rsquo;s <em>Watchmen</em> TV series</a> which would, like the comics, receive wide critical praise and commercial success and currently has a 96% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. However the show would differ significantly from the comics taking place thirty four years after the events in the comic books and focusing on racist violence in modern-day Tulsa, Oklahoma, the location of the tragic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre">Tulsa Race Massacre</a> in 1921.</p>
<h2 id="dcs-struggle-with-feature-films">DCâs struggle with feature films</h2>
<p>DC is not known for making good live action adaptations of their comic book characters, aside from the Batman movies. I won&rsquo;t go into details, but I&rsquo;ll list a few: <em>Steel</em>, <em>Catwoman</em>, <em>Constantine</em>, <em>Superman Returns</em>, <em>Jonah Hex</em>, <em>Green Lantern</em>, <em>Man of Steel</em>, <em>Suicide Squad</em>, <em>Justice League</em>, <em>Shazam!</em>, <em>Black Adam</em>, <em>The Flash</em>, and <em>Blue Beetle</em> are most of their releases in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), and none of them performed well when compared to Marvelâs blockbuster run. There is, however, one medium in which DC has excelled and Marvel has not; animation. Their animated films, generally referred to as the DC Animated Universe, or DCAU, are produced by Warner Bros. Animation studio.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For a complete list of all DCAU animated films released, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_based_on_DC_Comics_publications#Theatrically_released_films">check the Wikipedia entry</a>.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From 1993&rsquo;s <em>Batman: Mask of the Phantasm</em> to the just released <em>Watchmen Chapter I</em>, DC has floated a literal armada of top-notch animated features. Sure, there have been duds like the unfortunate adaptation of the already unpopular comicbook, <em>Batman: The Killing Joke</em>, the 2nd and 3rd installments of the three part <em>Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths</em> film trilogy, and <em>Superman/Batman: Apocalypse</em> but there have been a lot more highly rated outings like <em>Batman: Under the Red Hood</em>, <em>Justice League: Doom</em>, the sublime <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Parts 1 &amp; 2</em>, and <em>Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox</em>. There are many, many more out of the near 60 films so don&rsquo;t feel bad if I&rsquo;m leaving off one of your favorites. Iâve already listed a lot of films, so let&rsquo;s just move on to <em>Watchmen Chapter I</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Editorâs Note</strong>: While DC has had an enormously successful run of animated features, the medium of animation in America has been relegated to the juvenile markets. There are pockets of successful adult animation, like <em>Family Guy</em> and other animated sit-coms and sci-fi like <em>Scavengers Reign</em>, but on the whole, animation isnât taken seriously in the US.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-breakdown">The breakdown</h2>
<p>Now, normally for a review of an animated film, television show, or short I would not go through the history that lead up to that property&rsquo;s release, but <em>Watchmen</em> is different. Since it hit comic book shop shelves in 1986 and hasnât been developed into a continuing franchise of any significance. I suspect a lot of our younger folk born since 2000 may not be as familiar with the comics as with older readers and an overview is helpful to understand the significance of <em>Watchmen</em> in relation to our history. So, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the spoiler-free Wikipedia synopsis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Watchmen is set in an alternate reality that closely mirrors the contemporary world of the 1980s. The primary difference is the presence of superheroes. The point of divergence occurs in the year 1938. Their existence in this version of the United States is shown to have dramatically affected and altered the outcomes of real-world events such as the Vietnam War and the presidency of Richard Nixon. In keeping with the realism of the series, although the costumed crimefighters of Watchmen are commonly called &ldquo;superheroes&rdquo;, only one, named Doctor Manhattan, possesses any superhuman abilities. The war in Vietnam ends with an American victory in 1971 and Nixon is still president as of October 1985 upon the repeal of term limits and the Watergate scandal not coming to pass. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan occurs approximately six years later than in real life.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>When the story begins, the existence of Doctor Manhattan has given the U.S. a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union, which has dramatically increased Cold War tensions. Eventually, by 1977, superheroes grow unpopular among the police and the public, leading them to be outlawed with the passage of the Keene Act. While many of the heroes retired, Doctor Manhattan and another superhero, known as The Comedian, operate as government-sanctioned agents. Another named Rorschach continues to operate outside the law.</strong></em> [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen">SOURCE</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-fundamentals">The fundamentals</h2>
<p>The film lines up quite neatly with the comics. <em>Chapter I</em> covers the first five books of the twelve book series and the opening scene is almost a shot-for-shot, word-for-word adaptation of the opening pages. In fact, without having had the trade paperback in front of me while watching I could still tell that much of Alan Moore&rsquo;s gritty dialog and story beats are translated almost directly from the comics to the screen with some streamlining by screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski (<em>Babylon 5</em>, <em>World War Z</em>, <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em>). <em>Watchmen</em> is very character-driven, so a lot of time is spent with a focus on said characters. However, it is the comicâs more fleshed out dialog in which we get a larger sense of the world of Watchmen that appears to have been trimmed. A simple truth illustrating the differences between the comic and animation mediums is that what we do get in terms of texture and detail is often lost in the flow of the motion picture as we are unable to linger on panels and soak in the additional context that the comics allow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Documenting all the little changes would take me a lot more time than I am willing to invest. Suffice it to say that the changes do not, as of yet, necessarily detract from the story and help to frame the necessary pacing for the motion-based medium versus the static page while maintaining the overall story arc of the first five issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Character design is, due mostly to the 3D CGI, smoother and slightly less textured than the meticulous art of Dave Gibbons (illustration and lettering) and John Higgins (colorist). The positives, however, are that there are no speech bubbles to obfuscate the visuals, the view is wider than in the comic panels, and we can see the body language of characters in motion. One early illustration of the differences is when Dan Dreiberg (Nite Owl II, voice acted by Matthew Rhys) comes home to find Rorschach (Walter Kovacs, voice acted by Titus Welliver) has broken into his front door and is eating cold beans straight from cans in his kitchen. Rorschach&rsquo;s iconic pattern shifting mask is pulled up above his nose revealing the lower half of his face. In the comics, he clearly hasn&rsquo;t shaved in days and has baked bean sauce on his chin where in the film he&rsquo;s clean-shaven, as shown in the comparison below. This is a nitpick, but it&rsquo;s indicative of some of the visual sanitization of the adaptation, likely for budget reasons and/or time constraints. For now, however, that remains speculation.</p>
<p><img src="https://tknblogs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/watchmen-scene-comparison-2024.jpg" alt="LEFT: My 2005 copy of Watchmen, RIGHT: The same scene in the 2024 film."></p>
<p>The comics are laid out by Gibbons in a perfect grid of three by three rectangular panels, only deviating to group into larger panels or , less often, divide them even further into smaller ones, but always maintaining the pureness of 90Âº angles. I find that this helps define the pacing of the comics, like driving with a steady beat to the ultimate climax of the tale. For the film, overall shot composition, set design, and world building are moderately strong, but is somewhat lacking in the ticking urgency in comparison to the source material. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock">Doomsday Clock</a> plays a major role in the comics. The panel layout helps to subtly sell the slowly encroaching time, and I feel that is lost in this first chapter, though I can honestly say I donât know how theyâd fix that. The strategically placed shots of period newspapers, however, help to sell the stakes. If you can are able to see them in time.</p>
<p>There are many things to like about the animation. Color, lighting, and atmospherics are strong. The colors are vibrant and clean while still delivering that dark, foreboding, dismal feeling of experiencing a time on the edge. While the animation technique used is cel-shading it feels very mature, like many strides have been made in technique since 2004âs <em>Appleseed</em>, so it helps to deliver the appearance of the comics coming out of the pages. The one character that really jumped out at me, however, is Dr. Manhattan, and I think that this is mostly due to the fact that his radiation glow eliminates the need for cel-shading.</p>
<p>Character movement does suffer a bit from 3D figure rigging, but itâs clear they attempted to put a lot of care into trying to make characters look organic and their body language look natural. The end result, however, is that despite that effort, itâs not always successful. As has become common with Western 3D animation the characters are animated on the âtwosâ, which means they are moved every other frame, a technique from traditional animation due to the extreme cost of animation on the âonesâ, or every frame. Unfortunately, there are a number of scenes where movement, such as walking, appears stiff. I am glad, however, that they didnât go with motion capture.</p>
<h2 id="the-ups">The Ups</h2>
<ul>
<li>One of my favorite parts of <em>Watchmen Chapter I</em> is the flawless handling of the dismally depressing <em>Tales of the Black Freighter</em> that appears as a comic inside both the comic books and the film.</li>
<li>I also very much like the application of textures throughout which work very well with the lighting and color work.</li>
<li>The application of depth of field is also excellent which makes me suspect that a cinematographer was involved in production.</li>
<li>There are also some truly beautiful shots in the film.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-downs">The Downs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Iâm not sure Iâd call it an animation error, per se, but during Dr. Manhattanâs Mars monologue where he reflects on the accident that changed him, there is a scene where two characters meet and walk away and one of their shoes appears to pass through a rock. It just seems to me that they should have put the rock somewhere else, but it really stood out to me.</li>
<li>The 84 minute run-time does not work in the filmâs favor, mostly because there is only one more part to be released. Unless Chapter II is significantly longer, they wonât be able to fully adapt all twelve issues of the comics.</li>
<li>Some of the ugly language from the comics is trimmed from the film. While I donât like the words used, they arenât applied gratuitously and have a sharp, cutting point that should have been maintained to illustrate the cultural and sociological undercurrents of division and fear that pervaded the US in the 80âs when the Cold War was intense and AIDS put people on edge.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Out of all of DCâs Warner Bros. Animationâs works <em>Watchmen Chapter I</em> sits near the top as one of the best, and not because itâs their first âRâ rated film. It is clear that the production team took the adaptation seriously, though were likely saddled with some constraints as illustrated by the short run-time, that there will only be one more part to complete the adaptation, and that quite a lot of contextual dialog was removed in translation.</p>
<p>What I would really like to see from DC, however, is a real commitment to their animation works teams of writers and animators. I would see that as an increase in budgets for their animated features and to use their writers for their live-action films to increase the script quality well over their current efforts that have plodded onto the big screen.</p>
<h2 id="tkns-nothing-score">TKN&rsquo;s Nothing Scoreâ¢</h2>

<p>This is my first go at a rating system, so bear with me. Iâm a nerd. I give <em>Watchmen Chapter 1</em> three and a half Macs, mostly for story and accuracy and detract points for not going all the way with the animation. Being such an important work from the 1980âs, I believe it deserved a lot more attention and care.</p>

<p>We spend a lot of time focusing on the National elections. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with this, but this singular gaze has, for years now, been shifting our attention from local issues to the National stage, and we do so to our civic peril. Over and over again we see so-called politicians leveraging public office for personal gain, regardless of party affiliation. Stay awake. Keep your head on a swivel. #uspol #localpolitics #california #corruption</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orange County Supervisors Katrina Foley and Vicente Sarmiento are calling for Supervisor Andrew Do to resign Wednesday as authorities investigate allegations of fraudulent spending of COVID-19 relief funds by a nonprofit that employed Doâs daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Earlier this month, the county sued the Viet America Society and its President Peter Pham, alleging misappropriation of millions of dollars of pandemic relief earmarked for delivery of meals to needy residents. The Hand to Hand Relief organization, which subcontracted with Viet America Society, was also sued.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently it&rsquo;s illegal to own historical artifacts in Bulgaria. Not a bad idea, to be honest. Such artifacts are snapshots of the rich history of humanity on our lone planet thriving with life in the solar system. It sucks that certain peeps are allowed to develop their own private collections. While I believe that in this case it was likely inadvertent, there are many more who selfishly or for investment purposes collect these items. Additionally, there is now more talk about presevation of cultural heritage going on now in Bulgaria. #history [<a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/08/12/beach-bar-sarcophagus-turns-out-to-be-genuine-roman-artefact">SOURCE</a>]</p>

If he&rsquo;s not projecting, he just makes up shit about them, like Harris being the &ldquo;Border Czar&rdquo;, a role she has <strong>never</strong> held.
