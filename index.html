			 <p><em>David Ellison has quietly courted Bari Weiss for a possible role at CBS News—a move that hints at how he may steer the network if his merger goes through.</em></p>
<p>by Oliver Darcy - June 24th, 2025 [<a href="https://www.status.news/p/bari-weiss-david-ellison-cbs-news">Source</a>]</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>David Ellison and Bari Weiss. Bari Weiss (Status Illustration/Leigh Vogel/Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images)</em></p>
<p>Late last year, during a trip to New York City, David Ellison quietly made time for a meeting that said as much about his worldview as it did about his interest in media. According to people familiar with the matter, the Hollywood scion set time aside on his busy calendar to meet with Bari Weiss, the founder of The Free Press. Ellison, like a number of C-suite executive types, has long been an admirer of Weiss’ style of journalism, I&rsquo;m told, viewing her as one of the more compelling voices in the shifting landscape of independent journalism. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>During the meeting, Ellison, who is set to control CBS News once the Paramount Global–Skydance Media deal closes, expressed strong interest in recruiting Weiss to work in some capacity with the network, according to people familiar with the matter. I&rsquo;m told that Ellison appeared to leave a wide range of options on the table, signaling that he sees Weiss as a valuable addition while he considers how to put his stamp on the news division. While a management role is not said to be on the table, it would not be out of the range of possibilities that she could be named as an on-air contributor or even perhaps given a coveted correspondent position on “60 Minutes.”</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s unclear whether the discussions between Ellison and Weiss ever advanced beyond the meeting late last year and a representative for Skydance declined to comment. Weiss did not respond to a request for comment. Regardless, the fact that the conversation occurred at all offers an early glimpse of Ellison’s thinking and how he plans to reshape the storied news organization, once home to the likes of Walter Cronkite and Edward R. Murrow.</p>
<p>In recent years, Weiss has become a major star in right-wing media, known for assailing mainstream institutions as out of touch and under the trance of the &ldquo;woke&rdquo; left. Weiss has also gained significant notoriety for chastising and portraying mainstream news outlets, including CBS News, as biased instruments of the progressive elite. While Weiss might be popular in certain circles, many journalists view her unfavorably, criticizing both her tactics and views.</p>
<p>That Ellison would entertain bringing her into the fold signals not only his appetite for shaking up the network, but also the kind of voices he might turn to. Not only does Ellison appear to be interested in looking beyond traditional broadcasting talent, but he appears to be on board with introducing voices that have made their names by relentlessly criticizing—or outright bashing—the legacy press.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Weiss outreach offers one of the first tangible clues as to how Ellison might seek to chart a new course for CBS News, given that he has remained largely silent in public about his vision for the network. While Ellison hasn’t spelled out his plans, he&rsquo;s recently been spotted ringside at UFC fights alongside Donald Trump as he seemingly tries to win over the president for government approval of his protracted merger. Taken together, the actions suggest Ellison may be comfortable moving the network in a direction that aims to appeal more to right-leaning audiences—whether because of his personal preference, the current political moment, or both.</p>
<p>Of course, inside CBS News, the journalists are on edge about what their new parent company will do with the organization, particularly after network boss Wendy McMahon and &ldquo;60 Minutes&rdquo; chief Bill Owens both resigned earlier this year in protest over corporate interference. Morale inside &ldquo;60 Minutes,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m told, is at a nadir, with staffers uncertain what the future holds for the crown jewel of American broadcast journalism. Moreover, broadly throughout the organization, staffers are anticipating the new owners will seek to implement budget cuts when they get the keys to the palace—and they’re not wrong to harbor such worries.</p>
<p>For now, however, Ellison’s exact plans for CBS News remain unclear and the Skydance team is holding those cards close to the vest. But his meeting with Weiss—and the broader questions it raises about the kind of talent he might seek to bring in—is sure to add to the unease already coursing through the newsroom. What is certain is that CBS News is making its way through a period of profound uncertainty, as employees wait to see what is in store for them, just around the corner.</p>
<h2 id="my-words">My Words</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really bad time to be putting critical reporting like this behind a paywall. I&rsquo;ll take it down if asked, but I believe everyone needs to be able to read this, not just those in the know or who can afford to. The oligarchy has been working hard for a very long time to grapple back their stranglehold over the American economy. The ultra wealthy are snapping up anything of value, monetary, production, competitive, and messaging platforms alike, in order to have greater control over what we see, hear, buy, have access to, and otherwise consume, and not for the betterment of society. Read this. Share this. We clearly can&rsquo;t stop it, as much as the courts can stop the Trump Administration from breaking the law and the Constitution, but if we know, we can stop watching CBS altogether. #capitalism #journalism #uspol #editorial</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been having a lot of bad days of late dealing with a wide range of pains, brain fog, an accursed tinnitus that averages an 8 out of 10 on the loudness scale, unending exhaustion, and other issues. As a writer by trade, these are all crushing, but I keep trying to post.</p>
<p>What I need is to write something substantial, but for the past year or so I&rsquo;ve been unable to do much. I haven&rsquo;t blogged in weeks and filling my days with playing video games, watching YouTube, and drowning out the ringing in my head with music sessions in my AirPods is entirely unproductive.</p>
<p>In the middle of July I shall turn 57 and I&rsquo;m nowhere near done yet, but the ongoing issues stemming from Long Covid, a bad motorcycle accident in 1990, degenerative disc disease, and arthritis have erected blockades that make it nearly impossible for me to engage in the one thing at which I&rsquo;m actually decent.</p>
<p>Just ugh. #health #mentalhealth #writing #chronicpain</p>

<p>We are being harassed by the International Association of Professional Writers and Editors, also known as IAPWE. We signed up for memberships a few years ago, then cancelled after our first year. We found no benefit to the membership. Now, despite cancelling everything we could find on PayPal, speaking with the credit card servicer who can do nothing, and emailing IAPWE over and over and over again, they continue to charge us.</p>
<p>We both subscribed using PayPal, and we&rsquo;ve no clue how they got our card details to charge us directly! I&rsquo;m going to assume they can see all those details in the PayPal dashboard, which is frightening. The image above is a receipt from earlier this year, but the charges have not stopped.</p>
<p>This has been going on for over a year now, and we can&rsquo;t stop it. We&rsquo;ve considered cancelling the card, which is provided to my wife by her professional union, if this continues. Our emails to them used to get professional responses claiming they would stop, but now they don&rsquo;t even bother to respond, even to threats of legal action. At least cancelling the PayPal accounts has stopped that vector.</p>
<p>I am posting this as both a warning against considering membership with IAPWE as well as a reminder of the almost complete lack of control we have over our money. It&rsquo;s utterly maddening. Be careful, please. It&rsquo;s not the amount they&rsquo;re trying to take, but the principal. If they do this to enough unsuspecting people, they could be making a lot of free money if it turns out they are indeed a scam operation. #capitalism #PSA #moneymatters #personalfinance #writing #writers

<p>Part of the payment I must make to Satan to save my soul from eternal damnation is to prepare a detailed listing of all anime that Geoff lists in his Mother&rsquo;s Basement videos on YouTube. Just kidding. I do it because I love it and want to help peeps retain the font of knowledge that Geoff shares with us in his various videos. Today&rsquo;s video is a comprehensive breakdown of the ten worst anime of all time. Yes, the worst of the worst or the animated equivalent of emotional torture. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This is a list of anime series to AVOID. These shows are NOT like the Hottest Trash which you can watch because sometimes bad == good. So, please don&rsquo;t watch these, unless you&rsquo;re a sadist&hellip; or a masochist who wishes to inflict emotional pain on unsuspecting victims. Knowing, according to G.I. Joe, is half the battle. Be kind. Spare your mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now for the list. I&rsquo;m sorry:</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Rent-A-Girlfriend or How to make your entire cast unlikeable</li>
<li>The Promised Neverland Season 2 which never happened and makes people really mad</li>
<li>Conception: How to make babies then use them to fight wars</li>
<li>Seven Deadly Sins &hellip; &ldquo;Really, I blow away mountains for breakfast.&rdquo; - a mountain. Oof.</li>
<li>My Life as Inukai-san&rsquo;s Dog which is about&hellip; um, &ldquo;animal husbandry&rdquo; but borderline illegal?</li>
<li>The Happy Science Collection: Religious cults, brainwashing, &amp; propaganda for children!</li>
<li>The Irresponsible Galaxy Tylor. I&rsquo;ve never been more ashamed, and now consider it misspelled.</li>
<li>Hand Shakers or Motion Sickness: The Animation, now with more sexual perversion!</li>
</ol>
<p>For the coup de gras Geoff combines the two worst into a Mega Worst, both of which just happen to be Crunchyroll Originals:</p>
<p>2 (and 1). Ex-Arm - All the Don&rsquo;ts and None of the Do&rsquo;s of Anime &amp; Visual Storytelling
1 (and 2). Gibiate - Mind control agitprop films for insane people being held at CIA blacksites</p>
<p>Once again I feel the need to remind you of the psychological damage that you can incur from viewings of the above listed media. Please take this list as a warning and keep this guide handy when reviewing new series to add to your watchlist in order to avoid accidental damage to the psyches of you or those you care for.</p>
<p>For additional details, please refer to the original source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNIGWx8PIRg">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>

			 <p>Fascinating how a lot of solutions for fixing complex resource problems caused by the explosive growth of humanity frequently go back to the cradle of life; the ocean. Deep Sea Reverse Osmosis (DSRO) seems like a great solution for our water problems. Just watch the video, but in short it reduces the power consumption by 60% over land-based RO desalination plants, and avoids a lot of its complications. #science #tech #drought #water <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu_IcFpEkg0">www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>

<p>In his latest video Luke Miani asks if #Apple made their new machines too good. Across two polls, having run a second one to verify the results of the first, respondents strongly indicated they had no intention of upgrading their early M-series Macs. I have a feeling Apple fully expected that, however. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-BufKw124A">Watch the video on YouTube</a>. We have three Mini&rsquo;s, two M1 and one Intel, and have no need to upgrade them anytime soon. I may <em>desire</em> an M4 Mini, but I don&rsquo;t <em>need</em> one. What is behind this?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>To understand this there are, I believe, two different, unrelated factors that need to be taken into consideration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apple&rsquo;s primary drivers of revenue are the #iPhone, the App Store, and services.</li>
<li>There are millions upon millions of #Windows users who might choose to move to Apple rather than be forced upgrade to Windows 11 but cannot since their hardware is incompatible, because #Microsoft has chosen to enshittify their desktop with ads and #AI, or both.</li>
</ol>
<p>Apple&rsquo;s personal computer marketshare has long been around 20% with Microsoft dominating for literal decades with 72% of the PC market. But it&rsquo;s critical to understand that a decade ago Microsoft had well over 80%, and it continues to slowly decay. The iPhone plays a significant role in the fact that Apple has a $2.5T valuation, as consumers tend to upgrade every two years, giving Apple a mostly reliable playing field to project consistent revenues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Microsoft has a similar market capitalization to Apple but the important distinction is that Microsoft engages in a wide range of markets, including corporate software and services, as well as the Xbox and video games publishing, all of which contribute to the company&rsquo;s bottom line. Apple still competes by offering a mere fraction of the models and verticals of its rivals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That consistency is crucial. It allows Apple to not only sit back and just let their Mac users be Mac users and upgrade as they please, but also breathing room for some mild experimentation with various services and hardware. The iPhone Mini was available for the iPhone 12 and 13 then cancelled to be replaced by the Plus model, which has been around longer than the Mini. And the next rumored experiment will be the iPhone Air which may appear this October. They&rsquo;ve also got enough in the bank to allow them to pivot and shift based on unforeseen market fluctuations or, in the case of component availability, weather the less than stellar rollout of the moderately underwhelming M3 processor.</p>
<p>And Apple isn&rsquo;t blind. I&rsquo;m quite sure that one major consideration in their calculations is Microsoft and their recent &ldquo;efforts&rdquo; to tank their own success. Users are unhappy with Windows 11 and in October of this year Microsoft will be ending support for the far more popular Windows 10. <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/windows-11-market-share-april-2024/">Many users are even downgrading to Windows 10 to escape the oppressive changes in Windows 11</a>. In addition, the upgrade to Windows 11 requires support for TPM 2.0 which will &ldquo;relegate&rdquo; millions of unsupported systems to be discarded or sold for cheap, an outcome that is exciting many nerds over the prospect of a torrent of dirt cheap or free computers which can happily and securely run #Linux and other operating systems. Linux is an easy and capable migration path, but being honest with ourselves, most Windows users won&rsquo;t go this direction.</p>
<p>I think Apple knows this. For one, they&rsquo;ve maintained a stability in offerings that is appealing when compared to Microsoft&rsquo;s numerous radical shifts over the years, the frequency of which has started to turn off consumers. Second, Apple has been aggressive in allowing resellers to offer significant sale pricing and even has an exclusive deal with <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Space-Gray-M1-Chip-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage/609040889">Walmart to sell new M1 Macbook Air</a> base models for $700 and which is on seemingly permanent sale for $650. In most of Apple&rsquo;s history this is unprecedented, as they have for decades required resellers to match their own pricing and not offer sales. Finally, Apple&rsquo;s resale value for their Intel models has dropped precipitously and used M1 and M2 machines are a lot more affordable than they used to be, presenting an enticing option for budget buyers.</p>
<p>Apple, for the most part, has played the long game. Pixar focused on getting one particular element perfected for each film so they might add that element to their toolbox for later films like fur in Monsters Inc. and the ocean in Finding Nemo. Apple has done much the same, working on iterations of various elements of their systems, refining them until they meet their internal expectations for excellence. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a coincidence that Steve Jobs ran both and had, with help from others to manifest his vision, been instrumental in forming the foundations of two entire industries. Ingest that in whatever form you prefer.</p>
<p>The short answer to the question posed by Luke is no. The suggestion that CEO Tim Cook and the entire team at Apple could have miscalculated that the potential longevity of their products could cause Apple, one of the wealthiest corporations on planet Earth, to disintegrate or fall into the doldrums of relevance is in itself a miscalculation of what Apple is and how it operates. Is Apple flawless? Hell no. Most recently, I think they horribly miscalculated both the retail price and consumer interest in Apple Vision. There are other failures dotting Apple&rsquo;s history, as well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they basically own the tablet market. Full stop. They swap first and second place with Samsung for mobile phone volume, and Samsung has to make dozens of models to compete with Apple. AirPods are stupid popular. The Apple Watch has a huge chunk of the smart watch market. Apple is doing well, and all whilst offering a fraction of the options of others they compete with.</p>

<p>Ok. Here&rsquo;s the deal. I&rsquo;ve decided it&rsquo;s high time I completely rebuild my RSS feeds to improve my sources for information, and I&rsquo;d love some help. I used to follow a number of older, formerly reliable sites for tech and other news, but I&rsquo;ve noted the steep increase in promoted goods, advertorials, listicles, and other junk gumming up my NetNewsWire feed. As such, l&rsquo;ve become less interested in scanning for interesting tidbits of late.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>The goal is not only to update my feeds and improve the quality of my incoming information, but to share it with whomever has like interests or would like a pre-curated base to start from. The first version is linked at the bottom of this post, and I&rsquo;ll be posting updates periodically as I make suggested changes.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To facilitate this I&rsquo;ve setup a new file to build out this new collection of sources, imported my current OPML, and have trimmed out what I think are the biggest contributors to fluff in my current file. Sadly, this culling has left certain categories a tad light. I&rsquo;m attaching my XML export to this post (see the last line) and asking for ideas. The following is a list of my existing categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animation (with a particular focus on anime, but I&rsquo;m into all animation)</li>
<li>Apple (current and retro, which is pretty much all of it, I guess&hellip;)</li>
<li>Automotive (mostly petrol vehicles, rally, touring car, but all is good)</li>
<li>Bloggers (preferably in the categories listed here)</li>
<li>Film &amp; TV (I love scifi, but I&rsquo;m good with most everything except drama and mobster)</li>
<li>Linux it seems harder to find good sources that are regularly updated)</li>
<li>News &amp; Politics (I&rsquo;m a progressive humanist, but need unbiased sources. I know, big ask)</li>
<li>Technology (mostly computers, but I&rsquo;m wide open. I adore small gadgets, though)</li>
<li>Video Games (I&rsquo;m a handheld emulator gamer, Steam user of nigh 20 years, and Nintendo head)</li>
<li>Vintage Computing (mostly Apple and ThinkPads, but I&rsquo;m interested in all retro gear)</li>
<li>Writing (I am, after all, a writer&hellip;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is a recent screenshot of my Feedbin Unread page:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have a framework that I am applying to myself and ask those pitching in to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>No Al or crypto centric content. I recognize that technology news covers Al and that crypto is &ldquo;popular&rdquo; which is fine, but I don&rsquo;t want any sources that focus on them.</li>
<li>The source needs to either have direct support for RSS or, if not, l&rsquo;d like it if you provided a scraper source. If I can&rsquo;t import it into my reader, I&rsquo;ll be a lot less inclined to read it.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not a programmer so nothing programming specific, but I love technical stuff about chips, architectures, and other like frameworks.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m open to taking suggestions for new categories, so feel free to drop your ideas on me.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m also open to debating everything and I have an open mind so will consider the removal or inclusion of just about anything. So, don&rsquo;t be shy or presume I&rsquo;ll not like something. I may be judgmental about things, but not people.</li>
<li>Avoid duplication of stories. I know that this is nigh impossible with certain categories, but I&rsquo;m going to at least try.</li>
<li>This a going to be a public OPML, so I won&rsquo;t be including anything that would be on your typical list of &ldquo;things not allowed&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t think I need to list them out for you to get what I mean.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s pretty much it. I&rsquo;ll likely edit this post over time as internet reality shifts like the sands of a desert, but this is a good place to start. Then someone recently told me something that struck me&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Ignore what you hate and direct your energy toward celebrating the things you love.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While they were speaking about my media-related posting, I think it applies to life in general. I am not willing to give up on the news that is important and I need to be a part of redirecting America towards a better future for all human life, but maybe I also need to start being positive and talk about the things I like, love, and appreciate.</p>
<p>As for participating, you can comment here, on the Mastodon post, or on the Bluesky post, to which I will add links for after I&rsquo;ve published this first post. I&rsquo;ll do my best to keep track of it all and be responsive.</p>

<p>Had I known that I could <a href="https://www.guidingtech.com/how-to-use-a-mouse-with-your-iphone/">connect a Bluetooth mouse to my iPhone</a> and use the pointer to reorganize my Homescreen I would have done that a long time ago. Apparently, this has been a feature since iOS 13, and later added to iPadOS 13.4. I know that using a pointer on my iPad is quite useful, but it never occurred to me to think I could do the same on my iPhone. As luck would have it, a fix found me!</p>
<p>&lt;!-more-&gt;</p>
<p>When I came across <a href="https://tinyblocks.gumroad.com/l/minimaliphone?layout=profile">Tinyblock&rsquo;s Minimal iPhone Setup guide</a> in a toot on Mastodon I was intrigued. It&rsquo;s always taken so much time to organize, group icons into folders, set up the right widgets, and whatnot. Then you have to swipe around or open folders or, even worse, search to find an app. The Minimal iPhone Setup Guide promised an entirely new way to interact with my iPhone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: This guide requires certain features available in iOS 18 not earlier versions, so keep that in mind.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After donating a fiver* to the author I was redirected to the guide. I&rsquo;d never seen anyone deliver an experience using Notion before, and I was pleased with the experience. It works more like a slide deck app than just some hokey web page, and the formatting is nice and clean. The guide walked me through the steps of how to set up their concept of a Minimal iPhone Homescreen and had it set up in a total of about 15 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>*NOTE: The author lets you set the price you&rsquo;d like to pay for their work. I chose $5 US, and I felt that was perfectly fair. I ask that you consider a similar donation for their effort.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result is almost indistinguishable from a standard homescreen setup, but the added functionality is transformative. Using a clever combination of Focus modes, Shortcuts, and various iOS standards like the Dock, Lock Screen, and Control Center, you can configure a wide range of easily customizable dashboards that suit your needs in the moment. And, at least for four of these, at a single touch when placed in the Dock (as shown in the image below).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Left to right are my Dashboard, Blogging, Finances, and Multimedia pages, each accessed by a single tap to the icons in the dock. If you look closely, you&rsquo;ll note that the icon that appears next to the time roughly corresponds to the icon on the dock the page is associated with. The reason they are slightly different has nothing to do with the guide, but iOS. Focus and Shortcuts do not use the same icon sets. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. It would be nice if Apple were to fix that&hellip;</p>
<p>With this setup, I only have two folders (top left on my Blogging Focus) for things I need access to, but don&rsquo;t open very often. That means everything I use regularly is no more than two taps away or otherwise inside a folder, and often just the one tap to launch. And I can still Swipe Right to get the Today view and Swipe Left to get the App Library in each of the Focus modes.</p>
<p>For the first few days I found myself swiping like my old setup, but I soon got used to that and now I&rsquo;m fully on-board with this new approach to accessing apps. I highly recommend it to anyone who&rsquo;s tired of swiping and searching.</p>

<p>Tedious. Annoying. Unless you have some unnatural fondness for the very particular sub-sub-genre of horror known as &ldquo;screen life&rdquo;, which itself is a derivative of the mostly frustrating found footage sub-genre, then you will not like this film. I could barely get through ten minutes.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ll be brief. Due to the increasing costs to live we&rsquo;ve gotten behind on our lot rent and in order to stay in our home we need to pay the front office ~$6,000 by tomorrow at the latest. Despite our efforts, and with some small help from a few friends and my sister who are also strapped, we have something less than $5,000 once my wife gets paid, making us short by about $1,000. Our daughter is special needs and I am sick and cannot work. My wife is also unwell, but she continues to labor on making all of our income. Even though it&rsquo;s not my fault, I still feel guilty not being able to contribute, so I am doing the only thing I can and asking the internet for help.</p>
<p>Regardless of our desperate circumstance, I refuse to ask anyone to give more than $1. I strongly feel that our burden should not be a burden on others, but a larger community making small contributions can help meaningfully. Or, as someone once said, it takes a village. If you can give $1 a month, that would be a blessing. If you can only give once, I thank you. If you can share this and encourage others to help us with $1, that would be amazing. If enough people give, then we&rsquo;ll be able to get through this.</p>
<p>I prefer not to think of the inevitable alternative. <a href="https://ko-fi.com/dollarnomics">To give, please visit my Ko-Fi page</a>. <a href="https://tylerknowsnothing.com/2025/02/18/i-dont-believe-anyone-relishes.html">I&rsquo;ve also written a longer post on this subject which you can read here</a>.

			<h1><a href="https://tylerknowsnothing.com/2025/02/25/the-tea-on-the-framework.html">The tea on the Framework 2nd Gen 2025 event</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://tylerknowsnothing.com/2025/02/25/the-tea-on-the-framework.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-02-25 13:33:05 -0700">Feb 25, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>So, the #Framework event just ended and here&rsquo;s the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Framework 13</li>
<li>More work on Framework 16</li>
<li>Introduced Framework Desktop</li>
<li>Showed Desktop 4-board cluster case</li>
<li>Introduced Framework 12 Convertible</li>
</ul>
<p>For additional deets, click through. #tech #righttorepair <a href="https://youtu.be/dnCGwii7FqY?t=1594">youtu.be/dnCGwii7F&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dig in&hellip; First off, the Framework 13&quot; laptop has been updated for 2025 with new translucent bezels (including the crucial Atomic Purple) and AMD Ryzen AI 300 series APUs. Framework is also working on updating the Framework 16&quot; laptop with new large key stabilizers to eliminate noise and a new one-key module (more on that when I can get onto the website). The keyboard is also being updated with a Copilot logo, or without any Microsoft keys if you opt for the DIY models, and they have also shown off that they are working on an orthollinear design for fans of that layout. Pricing for the new Framework 13&quot; starts at $899 for the DIY model and $1,099 for the pre-built.</p>
<p>For the new products they first announced 4.5L desktop system. Still maintaining the Framework Right-to-Repair ethic but leveraging existing desktop PC standards, the new system features AMD&rsquo;s new Ryzen AI Max processor and comes in 32, 64, and 128GB RAM options. The RAM is soldered for the fastest possible speed, but prices remain reasonable at $1,099, $1,599, and 1,999, respectively. The desktop is available for pre-order now and the first batch will start shipping in Q3 of 2025.</p>
<p>The 32GB model comes with a Ryzen AI Max 385 8-core CPU, 32 graphics cores, two M.2 2280 NVMe storage slots, Wifi 7, a choice of Cooler Master and Noctua 120MM fans, and two slots on the front for Frameworks expansion cards, which are the same as the cards that are used on their laptops. The 64GB and 128GB models come with the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 16-core CPU, 40 graphics cores, and everything else that comes with the 32GB model.</p>
<p>They also showed off a cluster case that can take up to four Desktop boards and work as a desktop cluster for advanced operations. And on the lighter side, the front plate of the standard desktop case can take up to seven customizable or 3D printed tiles in various colors and logos.</p>
<p>Finally, they announced the new Framework 12&quot; Convertible Touchscreen laptop with pen support. Other than stating that it comes Intel&rsquo;s 13th gen mobile processors, but no other specifications. From the presentation and the sizzle reel on the product page however, I can see that this smaller device will have four expansion card slots like the Framework 13. Unfortunately there are no additional details, specs, pricing, or precise timing, but they are confident it will ship before the end of this year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve posted a few images from the presentation and the 12&quot; model sizzle reel as well as a link to the AMD version of the live stream already set to start when the presentation does. I will update this post as additional details are available.</p>

It&rsquo;s not like anyone gives a damn, anyway, and if they do there&rsquo;s nothing they can do to stop it, so again&hellip; who cares!</p>
<p>Take #Xitter&rsquo;s #CommunityNotes as an example. They were great because Musk didn&rsquo;t need to pay people to keep toxic shit off the Official Social Network of Shitposting® because the &ldquo;community&rdquo; would handle that. But now that those same notes are being &ldquo;gamed&rdquo; by filthy libs, &ldquo;he&rdquo; is going to have to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; them, so I guess not the bestest anymore?</p>
<p>These 20G 90º turns at speed are quite jarring. #socialmedia #tech #capitalism #fascism <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/elon-musk-to-fix-community-notes-after-they-contradict-trump/">arstechnica.com/tech-poli&hellip;</a></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe anyone relishes the idea of having to ask for help from strangers. We like to feel personally empowered, in control of our fates, and capable, but reality has a tendency to care little for our personal desires. While we have been blessed for many years to be able to keep a roof over our heads, we&rsquo;ve come close to disaster a few times. This is one of those times.</p>
<p>I will neither embellish nor sugarcoat. We need to raise around $7,000 to wipe our debt clean with the mobile home park we live in, and I need to ask for that help from strangers in order to raise that much. We&rsquo;ve been able to pay our mortgage, car note, and bills, but have fallen behind on the lot rent. I have asked what little family I have remaining, but they aren&rsquo;t in a position to help much. With the message I am also asking my friends to pitch in, and a few already have in the way they can.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing. I&rsquo;m not willing to ask people to give what they can. In fact, I&rsquo;m not willing to ask people to give more than $1. There is a fairness to this, I believe. It levels the playing field and eliminates the imbalance of imposing a burden on others to save my family. So, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m asking, for you to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/dollarnomics">go to my Ko-Fi page and grant to me $1 a month</a>. If you send more, as there is a facility to do so, I will return it. I&rsquo;m not asking for more money from individuals. I&rsquo;m asking for more individuals to give one, simple, plain, uncomplicated dollar.</p>
<p>The more who do so, the more we&rsquo;ll have. If those who contribute their $1 ask others they know to do the same, and that continues outward, then with a few thousand contributors, we&rsquo;ll have the funds we need to save our home and my little family without burdening anyone. That is my goal.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a simple family. My wife and I have been writers for decades and we were blessed with a daughter whom, after discovering she is Autistic and has epilepsy, remains an only child. And despite her challenges she achieved her Associates Degree at a local college and is an accomplished artist. And yet she still faces difficulties, so we have dedicated our lives to protecting her. And at the same time, we deal with our own issues. My wife has had all of one and most of the other adrenal glands removed for benign tumors, suffers from Cushing&rsquo;s Disease, and has had various other surgeries with complicated names I can never remember.</p>
<p>I am a structural mess having been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease in 1988 and having a motorcycle accident in 1990, I&rsquo;m starting to feel it in at 56 years old. I have had a knee replaced and will likely need to get the other one done, a cervical spinal fusion, and will need to get an arm bone shortened to relieve intense wrist pain. And we all caught Covid in February 2020 when I was still driving for Lyft in LA and Orange County. I had Shingles at the time, as well. That was fun. And I now suffer from a range of Long Covid symptoms and have been going through rounds of testing to for my own Cushing&rsquo;s Disease. Fate can be cruel.</p>
<p>There are additional societal and political issues at play in 2025, but I won&rsquo;t bother going into those. Suffice it to say that we may face additional existential challenges in an uncertain future. Our need is simple. Our request for help is simple. Again, all I ask is that you <a href="https://ko-fi.com/dollarnomics">go to my Ko-Fi page and agree to contribute one, single, solitary dollar to us on a monthly basis</a> and share this plea so that others might do the same. If enough do so, then we will have what we need to survive.</p>
<p>And again, if you send more, I&rsquo;ll send it back. If we get a lot more $1 subscribers than we need, then we&rsquo;ll donate the extra to others who need help or organizations that benefit those whom are othered or deemed less worthy. We are all human beings. We all deserve to have a place to call home and a little recognition, regardless of who we are, what we look like, what language we speak, who we love, or what we think or believe.</p>
<p>I thank you for your time.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Tyler</p>
<p>PS: You might note that my Ko-Fi page is named Dollarnomics. I have written two articles about this concept. The first one is <a href="https://tylerknowsnothing.com/2023/12/14/saving-the-internet.html">here</a> and the second one is <a href="https://tylerknowsnothing.com/2024/02/27/save-the-web.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>#writing  • Someone on the internet I have never met just poked me. So hard that it hurt. Her name is Liz and I forgive her because she didn&rsquo;t poke me personally. I might even liken it to jabbing myself, and all because she defined the word &ldquo;enough&rdquo; in my context.</p>
<p>In January of 2020, two months before it would have a name, my little family of three caught Covid-19. While we didn&rsquo;t experience any respiratory complications or need hospitalization, it was painful and exhausting, and I was dealing with a bout of Shingles at the same time. My right hip, thigh, and lower back have never recovered and still feel slightly numb. I blame the Covid.</p>
<p>Well, more precisely, I blame Long Covid. My particular variety includes brain fog, exhaustion, constipation, dry mouth, diminished taste and smell, and what&rsquo;s been termed by some as Post Exertion Malaise. I&rsquo;ve also been dealing with a cavalcade of musculoskeletal issues, mostly due to a motorcycle accident I had in 1990.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had my left knee replaced and will need to get the right one replaced at some point, a cervical spinal fusion, will probably need to get one of my arm bones shortened to alleviate wrist pain, and have been dealing with Degenerative Disc Disease since I was 19. Oh, and the arthritis, near non-stop tinnitus, and sciatica down both legs. I have a feeling I&rsquo;m forgetting some things, but this is enough.</p>
<p>In short, loads of fun.</p>
<p>All of these issues have had a significant impact on my ability to write. Writing is what I&rsquo;ve done professionally and as a blogger since 1996, with about twenty of those years in the computer book publishing industry where I contributed to about one hundred books. I started <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020802055015/http://www.pdahandyman.com:80/">PDA Handyman in 2002</a> and ran that blog for about eight years, as well. I&rsquo;ve written hundreds of blog posts, many I&rsquo;ve lost over time due to moving servers and being dumb, and some of which I still host here on my website.</p>
<p>Writing has been a part of my essence since I decided I wanted to be a writer when I was nine, and while it took many years for me to realize that dream, it has always been an endeavor filled with pain and joy&hellip; which is where Liz comes on. In her short, concise post on <a href="https://writerunboxed.com/2025/01/24/enough/">Writer Unboxed entitled &ldquo;Enough&rdquo;</a> she managed to poke me with a sharp stick and draw emotional blood. She didn&rsquo;t do it on purpose. She has no idea who I am. She simply related her experience, like a good writer. (You should read her post now. It&rsquo;ll be quick.)</p>
<p>But it hurt nonetheless. Maybe even more, since she was again able to find joy in writing. I, on the other hand, feel lost, like I might never again recover those aspects of writing that at once brought me happiness and the satisfaction of having accomplished something through the adversity of putting down words on a page. Creation, after all, is pain, but it&rsquo;s more than that. It&rsquo;s about all of the emotions, the good and the bad, that swirl around the process.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t focus. I have never had good memory recall, but in the past few years it&rsquo;s gotten significantly worse. I have days where my various sources of pain are just too intense. Following a terrible experience with opioids after my knee replacement, I haven&rsquo;t used them since, so all I have for pain relief are ibuprofen, pregabalin, and tylenol. As I go into my second day trying to complete this post my tinnitus is at a 9/10. It could be infuriating, but I&rsquo;ve been dealing with it for so long now I&rsquo;ve gotten used to it. That doesn&rsquo;t make it easier to manage, but I don&rsquo;t get mad about it much any more.</p>
<p>I used to have ideas just pop into my head all the time. That&rsquo;s mostly gone now. And yet, despite all these challenges, I still try. And that&rsquo;s when I realized that what Liz was saying about &ldquo;enough&rdquo; is what I&rsquo;ve been doing. I post about nerdy news and animation and comics I like and some politics here and there, but I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed sharing what I&rsquo;m #NowPlaying as one of my deepest loves is for music.</p>
<p>So maybe you are right, Liz. As a writer, it just has to be enough, I think. At least for now.</p>

			 <p>Don&rsquo;t watch the news today since all they&rsquo;ll be talking about is how great and normal it is to just hand an entire country over to a criminal in the name of a democracy that&rsquo;s been utterly broken and shreaded. If that leaves you unsure of what to do instead, here are some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen to some music. I&rsquo;ve been sharing my album plays, and here&rsquo;s a list of them that I refresh a few times a week. <a href="https://tylerknowsnothing.com/nothing-manor-jukebox/">tylerknowsnothing.com/nothing-m&hellip;</a></li>
<li>Go for a walk</li>
<li>Spend time with friends</li>
<li>Play a game like a board game, video games, or get into table-top role-playing games (TTRPG), or even just a few dozen rounds of poker</li>
<li>Read a book like Isaac Asimov&rsquo;s Robot series, many of which are murder mysteries. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_series">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robo&hellip;</a></li>
<li>Nap in a patch of sunlight or next to a warming fire with your kids and/or pets</li>
<li>Bake something like biscuits or pie or some nice, big potatoes and stuff them with cheese, bacon, sour cream, and chives, or whatever you like</li>
<li>Help out at your local homeless shelter or donate some old clothes to families in need</li>
<li>If you can afford it, slap a few hundred bucks on a gift card, go to that store, and pay for everyone until it runs out</li>
<li>Stop and smell some roses</li>
<li>Watch a movie or three like The Wild Robot (2024 on Apple TV, Google Play, Amazon Prime and more)</li>
<li>Write something nice on a pad of paper about nice and/or hopeful for yourself or someone you like</li>
<li>Get out an old computer and install Linux Mint and engage in some joyful technological discovery. <a href="https://linuxmint.com">linuxmint.com</a></li>
<li>Go out on a thrift shop crawl in your local area and buy some old things to give them a new home</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you must watch TV, then allow me to suggest one of the single most joyful and affirming shows ever made;l Netflix&rsquo;s <em>Somebody Feed Phil</em>. You will not regret it. Well, you&rsquo;ll regret having trouble eating the food Phil eats, unless you live in one of the cities he&rsquo;s covered.</p>
<p>Feel free to submit your own lists of things to do other than watch the news today. #animation #comics #manga #film #movies #linux #music #retrocomputing #humanrights #civilrights #scifi #tech #videogames #writing</p>

<p>#journalism #dollarnomics #editorial - Tyler K. Nothing reporting.</p>
<p>DATELINE INTERNETOPIA - #Substack has created a mythology in the form of the $15 a month newsletter. The claim was that it would help support independent writers who have been driven out of organized news gathering by capitalist greed&rsquo;s desire to &ldquo;trim the fat&rdquo; (meaning people who cost money they&rsquo;d rather have in their Cayman bank accounts), but the model is unsustainable. In reality, all it does is net Substack more revenue.</p>
<p>Of course, they need that larger cut to support the now far more bloated model that appears to include completely free hosting of a blog, unless you want to use your custom domain, and then you&rsquo;ll have to cough up $50&hellip; and then do it yourself. Yeah. You pay them to then do all the legwork. Liberating, indeed.</p>
<p>Whinging about fees nobody else charges aside, most newsletters are asking for $15 every single month. That doesn&rsquo;t get you an entire newspapers worth of content, but the words of one contributor. And Substack doesn&rsquo;t offer discounts for subscribing to multiple newsletters, so if you pay for three newsletters you will be forking over $45 a month.</p>
<p>That comes to $540 a year which is more than double what we pay annually to heat our water and dry our clothes. Imagine floating an entire newspaper&rsquo;s bullpen at those rates so one person could stay up-to-date with the news! Not that I would, but I can get a <a href="https://checkout.pasadenastarnews.com/">subscription to the Pasadena Star-News for $3.50 a week</a>. That&rsquo;s an actual newspaper with lots of contributors, sections, resources, and whatnot and it&rsquo;s still a buck less a month than that single newsletter.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t do this. It won&rsquo;t work. We cannot continue to rely on insanely wealthy oligarchs owning all of our local and national news, whose collective bias against a free press has become increasingly clear over the past few years, to transmit that bias into our consciousness on a daily basis.</p>
<p>If there is one thing we can do as, and I&rsquo;ll use the word yet again, a collective, it is to subscribe to an organic virtual bullpen of writers to produce open source news that everyone could benefit from, regardless of how deep (or shallow) their pockets are. Several such collectives would be even better. And let&rsquo;s start it at $5 a month with a sliding scale so readers can select a contribution they can afford.</p>
<p>The mainstream media, popularly known as the MSM in various circles, and the internet as a whole, has been slowly and methodically subsumed by the rich and powerful and turned into outlets for their increasingly unhinged desires to terraform society into something better suited to their wants and needs.</p>
<p>Look no further than Elon Musk&rsquo;s acquisition of Twitter and its rapid descent into madness. More recently Mark Zuckerberg has announced the end of fact checking on Facebook and other Meta platforms for reasons that are plainly disingenuous. X is much smaller than Facebook, but Facebook and Instagram represents 5 BILLION USERS.</p>
<p>If Mark is able to influence a mere 1% of his global userbase, that&rsquo;s 50 MILLION people.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just insane.</p>
<p>A solution requires two parties, creators and readers. We have the creators, but readers need to step up and be willing to pay a small monthly fee knowing that it will go towards the production of quality, reliable, fact-checked news gathering. Getting everything on the internet for free is a zombie shambling around a china shop, smashing everything and making a chaotic mess of things and we need to put it down, for good.</p>
<p>After all, you get what you pay for.</p>

			 <p>First, watch the linked video to get the scope of the leaks so far, if you haven&rsquo;t been tracking them already: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jCwJ80rfRY">www.youtube.com/watch</a> #videogames #nintendo #switch2 #leaks</p>
<p>If that is a PLUS button on the tablet side, that &ldquo;button&rdquo; looking thing on the top of the S2 Joycon could just be a lever to actuate it when the Joycon is connected. There may be added functionality for using the tablet without the Joycons which the PLUS and MINUS buttons could facilitate.</p>
<p>The ovoid next to the right shoulder button could just be a cover for an access screw. Another leaker mentioned that the shoulder buttons were the actual magnets? If so, then the slot/tab arrangement is likely a physical connector.</p>
<p>As for the source of the leaks, it could be Nintendo themselves who have authorized or sanctioned or even provided the leaks to the &ldquo;leakers&rdquo;, considering it&rsquo;s been getting loads of press coverage leading up to CES next week.</p>
<p>They could be taking the tack that since everyone already knows about it, why not leak the hardware in bits and pieces, let peeps speculate as much as they like, and drive the 24/7 news cycle. It would certainly be an interesting marketing scheme that has, so far, cost them nothing.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, whenever that is, it&rsquo;s going to be interesting on a number of levels. There are plenty of specifics remaining for Nintendo to clarify. I personally don&rsquo;t think that this coverage or these leaks have hurt them. They&rsquo;ve only helped them. The transition to a new console is typically a minefield for console makers. Just ask Microsoft about their botched Xbox One roll out.</p>
<p>The Switch is the 3rd best selling video game console of all time, so far, with 146 million units at last reporting. In 2nd place is their own DS portable with 154 million. In first place is Sony with the Playstation 2, meaning Nintendo is essentially first among modern consoles, as Sony&rsquo;s Playstation 4 still wasn&rsquo;t able to beat the 4th place finisher, Nintendo&rsquo;s Game Boy and Game Boy Color handhelds. (SOURCE: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_game_consoles">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll just have to wait and see, won&rsquo;t we.</p>

<p>I realized yesterday whilst doing a little research that I&rsquo;d been leaving out the Jazz Fusion genre as a tag and only using the Progressive Jazz tag, which not everyone will recognize. I&rsquo;ve now rectified that error :) This is my second favorite Simon Phillips album, though I do adore the Protocol projects, Midair Decision and Biplane to Bermuda being my two favorite tracks. My favorite remains 1999&rsquo;s Out of The Blue, however, with its more kinetic take on Midair Decision. I&rsquo;ll be playing that next :)</p>

<p>That sour, disappointed look flooded onto my wife&rsquo;s face. She was upset. I asked her what was wrong, and she explained to me that her Wordpress stats weren&rsquo;t working like they used to. I poked around and couldn&rsquo;t find anything obviously amiss in the Jetpack plugin settings, so I told her it was likely a glitch and would clear up. About a week later I got the email.</p>
<p>Wordpress had determined that my wife&rsquo;s social justice and political analysis blog (<a href="https://rimaregas.com">https://rimaregas.com</a>) was now deemed a commercial website and that she&rsquo;d need to pay up in order to continue getting the vital stats she needs to run her site. It is important to note here that we don&rsquo;t use Wordpress hosting, but Name.com website hosting, so her Wordpress installation is effectively self-hosted, and self-hosted sites have, for many years, been free of the capitalism of the official Wordpress hosting platform run by Automattic.</p>
<p>And how, you might ask, did they determine that the blog was now considered &ldquo;commercial&rdquo;? By asking for donations&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Automattic has been shifting the goal posts and clearly want to start milking the self-hosting crowd after spending more than a decade making Jetpack a vital component in almost any Wordpress installation, especially for small bloggers. We didn&rsquo;t need any of the paid upgrades and the free services offered were more than sufficient. Rima preferred to remain on the blogging platform she&rsquo;d become accustomed to, but this thing with the stats was the final straw. So, she decided to migrate away from Wordpress and selected Substack, the popular newsletter self-publishing tool that has grown into a blogging platform of its own, as her new platform.</p>
<p>I looked over everything. I combed through the settings and documentation to understand how everything worked and to verify a wide range of items like compatibility with Wordpress post imports and migrating her list of subscribers. One feature I even checked was if Substack had the ability to assign her domain name to her blog, and I was pleased to discover that indeed it did. I worked through the various tasks of getting everything configured for her and to essentially become a mirror of her Wordpress website which, after setting up the aforementioned custom domain with our DNS registrar, would be shut down.</p>
<p>In retrospect I&rsquo;d made one critical mistake, however&hellip; I&rsquo;d never clicked the link to setup the custom domain.</p>
<p>In all the years I&rsquo;ve been blogging and working with Wordpress and setting up websites and whatnot I have never once come across what I saw in the image at the top of this post. I&rsquo;ve seen far lower prices (around $5-10) and even annual fees, but these have always been for commercial systems designed for corporations, and you always expect that kind of chicanery in the enterprise realm, but not on the consumer internet. I&rsquo;m not a networking guru or anything like that, but I do know that setting DNS (Domain Name Services) to point one address at another address is, in short, a zero cost proposition.</p>
<p>The anger that welled up in me at the thought of having to pay $50 for an automated process that requires no technician involvement and what amounts to a tiny change in a text file on my registrars DNS server which is then propagated to other DNS servers (99.9% of which are not run by Substack) across the entire internet was profound. In fact, I am the one who does all the work, so I&rsquo;m paying Substack $50 and then doing the work myself? The concept is literally insane. There is no reality in which Substack&rsquo;s DNS servers are overburdened by custom domain name configurations. Period.</p>
<p>But Rima had already committed and we weren&rsquo;t going to turn back, so we haven&rsquo;t, but we also haven&rsquo;t dropped half a C-note for the privilege of getting to use the domain name we own on her blog. $50 is precious to us, but we will find a time at which we can do it. It just rankles that Substack has chosen to make free revenue from a service that isn&rsquo;t even their own and costs them nothing to implement.</p>
<p>Caveat emptor, I guess.</p>
<p>PS: Go check out <a href="https://rimaregasblog42.substack.com">rimaregasblog42.substack.com</a> for some quality writing and to see what Rima&rsquo;s tracking.</p>

I had a bootleg copy of the leaked album, bought it when it came out, and now listen to this expanded edition. It remains one of my favorite albums. #music #nowplaying</p>

			 <p>Despite Sixpence being labeled a Christian rock band, their #music is more progressive pop and the lyrics are generally quite abstract. Even as former PK turned avowed atheist, I find myself quietly singing along to Melody of You, and Leigh Nash&rsquo;s vocals are sublimely unique. #music #nothingmanor #nowplaying</p>

			 <p>Now Playing at Nothing Manor &ndash;&gt; Perfect Storm&rsquo;s Stairs (2024). From the opening track this Neo-Progressive rock band from The Netherlands wows with creative, accessible arrangements, excellent musicianship, and melodic lyricism from vocalists Adel Saflou and Hiske Oosterwijk, all driven by punchy metal guitar work, thumpy bass, expressive keyboards, and strong drum work. #music #progrock #rock <a href="https://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=11646">www.progarchives.com/artist.as&hellip;</a></p>

The new model can&rsquo;t pipe audio over the USB-C cable like crusty old Lightning can!!?? WTF, peeps!? If you can, don&rsquo;t kneecap your #headphone experience and get the Lightning model. Just wow. #music #audio <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2535548/who-needs-usb-c-when-the-lightning-airpods-max-are-150-off.html">www.macworld.com/article/2&hellip;</a></p>

Meanwhile, the Q hasn&rsquo;t been a big draw in #Windows laptops, what with compatibility issues and lackluster performance and efficiency. #tech #ARM <a href="https://liliputing.com/qualcomm-plans-to-bring-snapdragon-chips-to-600-laptops/">liliputing.com/qualcomm-&hellip;</a></p>

			 <p>Well, it seems that #RiotGames is hitting back at reports that they wasted $250 million on two seasons of their #Netflix animated series, #Arcane. In short, they&rsquo;re calling bullshit. The show was always supposed to be two seasons, and not the five being reported. And the cost? Apparently 80% of that is going to the #animation wizards at French studio #Fortiche, and the price tag is in service to the art and paying artists what they deserve. Fair. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/arcane-season-2-budget-riot-league-of-legends-netflix-2000525834">gizmodo.com/arcane-se&hellip;</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll freely admit that I avoided starting it because I expected to be forever disappointed by yet another excellent show being cancelled early and didn&rsquo;t want to be left hanging. I was, however, convinced to give it a go by a fellow Mastodonian, and I have to say, I have zero regrets.</p>

			 <p>When it comes to #tech press, one thing bothers me above all else; high-end reportage that ignores the bulk of users. The vast majority of people getting a #Mac probably don&rsquo;t even know what a virtual machine is, much less need one. Despite this, nerd journos almost exclusively focus on the much smaller professional slice of the market. #Apple #Journalism <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2524164/the-m4-macs-have-one-flaw-that-may-make-you-reconsider-buying-one.html">www.macworld.com/article/2&hellip;</a></p>
<p>In short, if you want to buy a new computer and use it like an average person, go ahead and get an M4 Mac Mini base model. Grab yourself a Samsung T7 external SSD in 1 or 2TB capacity, and rest easy that your $700+ will last you for years to come. The M4 is a little terror that sips power. Your email, messaging, social media, and streaming sessions will be just fine.</p>

<p>What can I say about <em>Watchmen</em> that hasn&rsquo;t already been said&hellip; is what I would say if DC hadn&rsquo;t just released the first part of an animated two part adaptation of what is considered one of the finest comic books of all time. But let&rsquo;s talk about the comic book first.</p>
<p>Released as a 12-issue limited series in 1986 and rendered into a trade paperback combining all twelve issues in 1987, the creation of writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons, and colored by John Higgins, <em>Watchmen</em> was a critical and commercial success and has remained so since its release. It would win a <a href="https://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1988-hugo-awards/">Hugo Award in 1988</a> and be added to <a href="https://entertainment.time.com/2005/10/16/all-time-100-novels/slide/all/">Time Magazine&rsquo;s 100 All-Time Best Novels list</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(film)">Zack Snyder&rsquo;s 2009 adaptation</a> was something of a critical success, but in no way a commercial one. On a $150 million dollar budget it only pulled in $187 million at the box office, or in other words a commercial flop. A Director&rsquo;s Cut would be released later in 2009, but that would only increase the film&rsquo;s appreciation amongst critics and would not contribute to the studio’s bottom line in any significant way. A decade later, HBO would release <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(TV_series)">Damon Lindelof&rsquo;s <em>Watchmen</em> TV series</a> which would, like the comics, receive wide critical praise and commercial success and currently has a 96% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. However the show would differ significantly from the comics taking place thirty four years after the events in the comic books and focusing on racist violence in modern-day Tulsa, Oklahoma, the location of the tragic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre">Tulsa Race Massacre</a> in 1921.</p>
<h2 id="dcs-struggle-with-feature-films">DC’s struggle with feature films</h2>
<p>DC is not known for making good live action adaptations of their comic book characters, aside from the Batman movies. I won&rsquo;t go into details, but I&rsquo;ll list a few: <em>Steel</em>, <em>Catwoman</em>, <em>Constantine</em>, <em>Superman Returns</em>, <em>Jonah Hex</em>, <em>Green Lantern</em>, <em>Man of Steel</em>, <em>Suicide Squad</em>, <em>Justice League</em>, <em>Shazam!</em>, <em>Black Adam</em>, <em>The Flash</em>, and <em>Blue Beetle</em> are most of their releases in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), and none of them performed well when compared to Marvel’s blockbuster run. There is, however, one medium in which DC has excelled and Marvel has not; animation. Their animated films, generally referred to as the DC Animated Universe, or DCAU, are produced by Warner Bros. Animation studio.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For a complete list of all DCAU animated films released, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_based_on_DC_Comics_publications#Theatrically_released_films">check the Wikipedia entry</a>.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From 1993&rsquo;s <em>Batman: Mask of the Phantasm</em> to the just released <em>Watchmen Chapter I</em>, DC has floated a literal armada of top-notch animated features. Sure, there have been duds like the unfortunate adaptation of the already unpopular comicbook, <em>Batman: The Killing Joke</em>, the 2nd and 3rd installments of the three part <em>Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths</em> film trilogy, and <em>Superman/Batman: Apocalypse</em> but there have been a lot more highly rated outings like <em>Batman: Under the Red Hood</em>, <em>Justice League: Doom</em>, the sublime <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Parts 1 &amp; 2</em>, and <em>Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox</em>. There are many, many more out of the near 60 films so don&rsquo;t feel bad if I&rsquo;m leaving off one of your favorites. I’ve already listed a lot of films, so let&rsquo;s just move on to <em>Watchmen Chapter I</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: While DC has had an enormously successful run of animated features, the medium of animation in America has been relegated to the juvenile markets. There are pockets of successful adult animation, like <em>Family Guy</em> and other animated sit-coms and sci-fi like <em>Scavengers Reign</em>, but on the whole, animation isn’t taken seriously in the US.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-breakdown">The breakdown</h2>
<p>Now, normally for a review of an animated film, television show, or short I would not go through the history that lead up to that property&rsquo;s release, but <em>Watchmen</em> is different. Since it hit comic book shop shelves in 1986 and hasn’t been developed into a continuing franchise of any significance. I suspect a lot of our younger folk born since 2000 may not be as familiar with the comics as with older readers and an overview is helpful to understand the significance of <em>Watchmen</em> in relation to our history. So, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the spoiler-free Wikipedia synopsis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Watchmen is set in an alternate reality that closely mirrors the contemporary world of the 1980s. The primary difference is the presence of superheroes. The point of divergence occurs in the year 1938. Their existence in this version of the United States is shown to have dramatically affected and altered the outcomes of real-world events such as the Vietnam War and the presidency of Richard Nixon. In keeping with the realism of the series, although the costumed crimefighters of Watchmen are commonly called &ldquo;superheroes&rdquo;, only one, named Doctor Manhattan, possesses any superhuman abilities. The war in Vietnam ends with an American victory in 1971 and Nixon is still president as of October 1985 upon the repeal of term limits and the Watergate scandal not coming to pass. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan occurs approximately six years later than in real life.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>When the story begins, the existence of Doctor Manhattan has given the U.S. a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union, which has dramatically increased Cold War tensions. Eventually, by 1977, superheroes grow unpopular among the police and the public, leading them to be outlawed with the passage of the Keene Act. While many of the heroes retired, Doctor Manhattan and another superhero, known as The Comedian, operate as government-sanctioned agents. Another named Rorschach continues to operate outside the law.</strong></em> [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen">SOURCE</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-fundamentals">The fundamentals</h2>
<p>The film lines up quite neatly with the comics. <em>Chapter I</em> covers the first five books of the twelve book series and the opening scene is almost a shot-for-shot, word-for-word adaptation of the opening pages. In fact, without having had the trade paperback in front of me while watching I could still tell that much of Alan Moore&rsquo;s gritty dialog and story beats are translated almost directly from the comics to the screen with some streamlining by screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski (<em>Babylon 5</em>, <em>World War Z</em>, <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em>). <em>Watchmen</em> is very character-driven, so a lot of time is spent with a focus on said characters. However, it is the comic’s more fleshed out dialog in which we get a larger sense of the world of Watchmen that appears to have been trimmed. A simple truth illustrating the differences between the comic and animation mediums is that what we do get in terms of texture and detail is often lost in the flow of the motion picture as we are unable to linger on panels and soak in the additional context that the comics allow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Documenting all the little changes would take me a lot more time than I am willing to invest. Suffice it to say that the changes do not, as of yet, necessarily detract from the story and help to frame the necessary pacing for the motion-based medium versus the static page while maintaining the overall story arc of the first five issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Character design is, due mostly to the 3D CGI, smoother and slightly less textured than the meticulous art of Dave Gibbons (illustration and lettering) and John Higgins (colorist). The positives, however, are that there are no speech bubbles to obfuscate the visuals, the view is wider than in the comic panels, and we can see the body language of characters in motion. One early illustration of the differences is when Dan Dreiberg (Nite Owl II, voice acted by Matthew Rhys) comes home to find Rorschach (Walter Kovacs, voice acted by Titus Welliver) has broken into his front door and is eating cold beans straight from cans in his kitchen. Rorschach&rsquo;s iconic pattern shifting mask is pulled up above his nose revealing the lower half of his face. In the comics, he clearly hasn&rsquo;t shaved in days and has baked bean sauce on his chin where in the film he&rsquo;s clean-shaven, as shown in the comparison below. This is a nitpick, but it&rsquo;s indicative of some of the visual sanitization of the adaptation, likely for budget reasons and/or time constraints. For now, however, that remains speculation.</p>
<p><img src="https://tknblogs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/watchmen-scene-comparison-2024.jpg" alt="LEFT: My 2005 copy of Watchmen, RIGHT: The same scene in the 2024 film."></p>
<p>The comics are laid out by Gibbons in a perfect grid of three by three rectangular panels, only deviating to group into larger panels or , less often, divide them even further into smaller ones, but always maintaining the pureness of 90º angles. I find that this helps define the pacing of the comics, like driving with a steady beat to the ultimate climax of the tale. For the film, overall shot composition, set design, and world building are moderately strong, but is somewhat lacking in the ticking urgency in comparison to the source material. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock">Doomsday Clock</a> plays a major role in the comics. The panel layout helps to subtly sell the slowly encroaching time, and I feel that is lost in this first chapter, though I can honestly say I don’t know how they’d fix that. The strategically placed shots of period newspapers, however, help to sell the stakes. If you can are able to see them in time.</p>
<p>There are many things to like about the animation. Color, lighting, and atmospherics are strong. The colors are vibrant and clean while still delivering that dark, foreboding, dismal feeling of experiencing a time on the edge. While the animation technique used is cel-shading it feels very mature, like many strides have been made in technique since 2004’s <em>Appleseed</em>, so it helps to deliver the appearance of the comics coming out of the pages. The one character that really jumped out at me, however, is Dr. Manhattan, and I think that this is mostly due to the fact that his radiation glow eliminates the need for cel-shading.</p>
<p>Character movement does suffer a bit from 3D figure rigging, but it’s clear they attempted to put a lot of care into trying to make characters look organic and their body language look natural. The end result, however, is that despite that effort, it’s not always successful. As has become common with Western 3D animation the characters are animated on the “twos”, which means they are moved every other frame, a technique from traditional animation due to the extreme cost of animation on the “ones”, or every frame. Unfortunately, there are a number of scenes where movement, such as walking, appears stiff. I am glad, however, that they didn’t go with motion capture.</p>
<h2 id="the-ups">The Ups</h2>
<ul>
<li>One of my favorite parts of <em>Watchmen Chapter I</em> is the flawless handling of the dismally depressing <em>Tales of the Black Freighter</em> that appears as a comic inside both the comic books and the film.</li>
<li>I also very much like the application of textures throughout which work very well with the lighting and color work.</li>
<li>The application of depth of field is also excellent which makes me suspect that a cinematographer was involved in production.</li>
<li>There are also some truly beautiful shots in the film.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-downs">The Downs</h2>
<ul>
<li>I’m not sure I’d call it an animation error, per se, but during Dr. Manhattan’s Mars monologue where he reflects on the accident that changed him, there is a scene where two characters meet and walk away and one of their shoes appears to pass through a rock. It just seems to me that they should have put the rock somewhere else, but it really stood out to me.</li>
<li>The 84 minute run-time does not work in the film’s favor, mostly because there is only one more part to be released. Unless Chapter II is significantly longer, they won’t be able to fully adapt all twelve issues of the comics.</li>
<li>Some of the ugly language from the comics is trimmed from the film. While I don’t like the words used, they aren’t applied gratuitously and have a sharp, cutting point that should have been maintained to illustrate the cultural and sociological undercurrents of division and fear that pervaded the US in the 80’s when the Cold War was intense and AIDS put people on edge.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Out of all of DC’s Warner Bros. Animation’s works <em>Watchmen Chapter I</em> sits near the top as one of the best, and not because it’s their first “R” rated film. It is clear that the production team took the adaptation seriously, though were likely saddled with some constraints as illustrated by the short run-time, that there will only be one more part to complete the adaptation, and that quite a lot of contextual dialog was removed in translation.</p>
<p>What I would really like to see from DC, however, is a real commitment to their animation works teams of writers and animators. I would see that as an increase in budgets for their animated features and to use their writers for their live-action films to increase the script quality well over their current efforts that have plodded onto the big screen.</p>
<h2 id="tkns-nothing-score">TKN&rsquo;s Nothing Score™</h2>
<p><img src="https://tylerknowsnothing.com/uploads/2024/tkn-rating-thumbsup.png" alt="1 of 5"><img src="https://tylerknowsnothing.com/uploads/2024/tkn-rating-thumbsup.png" alt="2 of 5"><img src="https://tylerknowsnothing.com/uploads/2024/tkn-rating-thumbsup.png" alt="3 of 5"><img src="https://tylerknowsnothing.com/uploads/2024/tkn-rating-half.png" alt="4 of 5"><img src="https://tylerknowsnothing.com/uploads/2024/tkn-rating-thumbsdown.png" alt="5 of 5"></p>
<p>This is my first go at a rating system, so bear with me. I’m a nerd. I give <em>Watchmen Chapter 1</em> three and a half Macs, mostly for story and accuracy and detract points for not going all the way with the animation. Being such an important work from the 1980’s, I believe it deserved a lot more attention and care.</p>

<p>Apparently it&rsquo;s illegal to own historical artifacts in Bulgaria. Not a bad idea, to be honest. Such artifacts are snapshots of the rich history of humanity on our lone planet thriving with life in the solar system. It sucks that certain peeps are allowed to develop their own private collections. While I believe that in this case it was likely inadvertent, there are many more who selfishly or for investment purposes collect these items. Additionally, there is now more talk about presevation of cultural heritage going on now in Bulgaria. #history [<a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/08/12/beach-bar-sarcophagus-turns-out-to-be-genuine-roman-artefact">SOURCE</a>]</p>
