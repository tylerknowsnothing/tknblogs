We didn&rsquo;t need any of the paid upgrades and the free services offered were more than sufficient. Rima preferred to remain on the blogging platform she&rsquo;d become accustomed to, but this thing with the stats was the final straw. So, she decided to migrate away from Wordpress and selected Substack, the popular newsletter self-publishing tool that has grown into a blogging platform of its own, as her new platform.</p>\n<p>I looked over everything. I combed through the settings and documentation to understand how everything worked and to verify a wide range of items like compatibility with Wordpress post imports and migrating her list of subscribers. One feature I even checked was if Substack had the ability to assign her domain name to her blog, and I was pleased to discover that indeed it did. I worked through the various tasks of getting everything configured for her and to essentially become a mirror of her Wordpress website which, after setting up the aforementioned custom domain with our DNS registrar, would be shut down.</p>\n<p>In retrospect I&rsquo;d made one critical mistake, however&hellip; I&rsquo;d never clicked the link to setup the custom domain.</p>\n<p>In all the years I&rsquo;ve been blogging and working with Wordpress and setting up websites and whatnot I have never once come across what I saw in the image at the top of this post. I&rsquo;ve seen far lower prices (around $5-10) and even annual fees, but these have always been for commercial systems designed for corporations, and you always expect that kind of chicanery in the enterprise realm, but not on the consumer internet. I&rsquo;m not a networking guru or anything like that, but I do know that setting DNS (Domain Name Services) to point one address at another address is, in short, a zero cost proposition.</p>\n<p>The anger that welled up in me at the thought of having to pay $50 for an automated process that requires no technician involvement and what amounts to a tiny change in a text file on my registrars DNS server which is then propagated to other DNS servers (99.9% of which are not run by Substack) across the entire internet was profound. In fact, I am the one who does all the work, so I&rsquo;m paying Substack $50 and then doing the work myself? The concept is literally insane. There is no reality in which Substack&rsquo;s DNS servers are overburdened by custom domain name configurations. Period.</p>\n<p>But Rima had already committed and we weren&rsquo;t going to turn back, so we haven&rsquo;t, but we also haven&rsquo;t dropped half a C-note for the privilege of getting to use the domain name we own on her blog. $50 is precious to us, but we will find a time at which we can do it. It just rankles that Substack has chosen to make free revenue from a service that isn&rsquo;t even their own and costs them nothing to implement.</p>\n<p>Caveat emptor, I guess.</p>\n<p>PS: Go check out <a href=\"https://rimaregasblog42.substack.com\">rimaregasblog42.substack.com</a> for some quality writing and to see what Rima&rsquo;s tracking.</p>\n<p>#capitalism #technology #editorial #substack #dns #enshittification</p>",

Rima preferred to remain on the blogging platform she'd become accustomed to, but this thing with the stats was the final straw. So, she decided to migrate away from Wordpress and selected Substack, the popular newsletter self-publishing tool that has grown into a blogging platform of its own, as her new platform. \n\nI looked over everything. I combed through the settings and documentation to understand how everything worked and to verify a wide range of items like compatibility with Wordpress post imports and migrating her list of subscribers. One feature I even checked was if Substack had the ability to assign her domain name to her blog, and I was pleased to discover that indeed it did. I worked through the various tasks of getting everything configured for her and to essentially become a mirror of her Wordpress website which, after setting up the aforementioned custom domain with our DNS registrar, would be shut down. \n\nIn retrospect I'd made one critical mistake, however... I'd never clicked the link to setup the custom domain. \n\nIn all the years I've been blogging and working with Wordpress and setting up websites and whatnot I have never once come across what I saw in the image at the top of this post. I've seen far lower prices (around $5-10) and even annual fees, but these have always been for commercial systems designed for corporations, and you always expect that kind of chicanery in the enterprise realm, but not on the consumer internet. I'm not a networking guru or anything like that, but I do know that setting DNS (Domain Name Services) to point one address at another address is, in short, a zero cost proposition. \n\nThe anger that welled up in me at the thought of having to pay $50 for an automated process that requires no technician involvement and what amounts to a tiny change in a text file on my registrars DNS server which is then propagated to other DNS servers (99.9% of which are not run by Substack) across the entire internet was profound. In fact, I am the one who does all the work, so I'm paying Substack $50 and then doing the work myself? The concept is literally insane. There is no reality in which Substack's DNS servers are overburdened by custom domain name configurations. Period. \n\nBut Rima had already committed and we weren't going to turn back, so we haven't, but we also haven't dropped half a C-note for the privilege of getting to use the domain name we own on her blog. $50 is precious to us, but we will find a time at which we can do it. It just rankles that Substack has chosen to make free revenue from a service that isn't even their own and costs them nothing to implement.\n\nCaveat emptor, I guess. \n\nPS: Go check out [rimaregasblog42.substack.com](https://rimaregasblog42.substack.com) for some quality writing and to see what Rima's tracking. \n\n#capitalism #technology #editorial #substack #dns #enshittification\n",

But let&rsquo;s talk about the comic book first.</p>\n<p>Released as a 12-issue limited series in 1986 and rendered into a trade paperback combining all twelve issues in 1987, the creation of writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons, and colored by John Higgins, <em>Watchmen</em> was a critical and commercial success and has remained so since its release. It would win a <a href=\"https://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1988-hugo-awards/\">Hugo Award in 1988</a> and be added to <a href=\"https://entertainment.time.com/2005/10/16/all-time-100-novels/slide/all/\">Time Magazine&rsquo;s 100 All-Time Best Novels list</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>For more details regarding the Watchmen comics, please refer to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen\">Wikipedia entry</a>.</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nSdg36526qU\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" allowfullscreen title=\"YouTube Video\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(film)\">Zack Snyder&rsquo;s 2009 adaptation</a> was something of a critical success, but in no way a commercial one. On a $150 million dollar budget it only pulled in $187 million at the box office, or in other words a commercial flop. A Director&rsquo;s Cut would be released later in 2009, but that would only increase the film&rsquo;s appreciation amongst critics and would not contribute to the studio’s bottom line in any significant way. A decade later, HBO would release <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(TV_series)\">Damon Lindelof&rsquo;s <em>Watchmen</em> TV series</a> which would, like the comics, receive wide critical praise and commercial success and currently has a 96% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. However the show would differ significantly from the comics taking place thirty four years after the events in the comic books and focusing on racist violence in modern-day Tulsa, Oklahoma, the location of the tragic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre\">Tulsa Race Massacre</a> in 1921.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dcs-struggle-with-feature-films\">DC’s struggle with feature films</h2>\n<p>DC is not known for making good live action adaptations of their comic book characters, aside from the Batman movies. I won&rsquo;t go into details, but I&rsquo;ll list a few: <em>Steel</em>, <em>Catwoman</em>, <em>Constantine</em>, <em>Superman Returns</em>, <em>Jonah Hex</em>, <em>Green Lantern</em>, <em>Man of Steel</em>, <em>Suicide Squad</em>, <em>Justice League</em>, <em>Shazam!</em>, <em>Black Adam</em>, <em>The Flash</em>, and <em>Blue Beetle</em> are most of their releases in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), and none of them performed well when compared to Marvel’s blockbuster run. There is, however, one medium in which DC has excelled and Marvel has not; animation. Their animated films, generally referred to as the DC Animated Universe, or DCAU, are produced by Warner Bros. Animation studio.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>For a complete list of all DCAU animated films released, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_based_on_DC_Comics_publications#Theatrically_released_films\">check the Wikipedia entry</a>.</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From 1993&rsquo;s <em>Batman: Mask of the Phantasm</em> to the just released <em>Watchmen Chapter I</em>, DC has floated a literal armada of top-notch animated features. Sure, there have been duds like the unfortunate adaptation of the already unpopular comicbook, <em>Batman: The Killing Joke</em>, the 2nd and 3rd installments of the three part <em>Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths</em> film trilogy, and <em>Superman/Batman: Apocalypse</em> but there have been a lot more highly rated outings like <em>Batman: Under the Red Hood</em>, <em>Justice League: Doom</em>, the sublime <em>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Parts 1 &amp; 2</em>, and <em>Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox</em>. There are many, many more out of the near 60 films so don&rsquo;t feel bad if I&rsquo;m leaving off one of your favorites. I’ve already listed a lot of films, so let&rsquo;s just move on to <em>Watchmen Chapter I</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Editor’s Note</strong>: While DC has had an enormously successful run of animated features, the medium of animation in America has been relegated to the juvenile markets. There are pockets of successful adult animation, like <em>Family Guy</em> and other animated sit-coms and sci-fi like <em>Scavengers Reign</em>, but on the whole, animation isn’t taken seriously in the US.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-breakdown\">The breakdown</h2>\n<p>Now, normally for a review of an animated film, television show, or short I would not go through the history that lead up to that property&rsquo;s release, but <em>Watchmen</em> is different. Since it hit comic book shop shelves in 1986 and hasn’t been developed into a continuing franchise of any significance. I suspect a lot of our younger folk born since 2000 may not be as familiar with the comics as with older readers and an overview is helpful to understand the significance of <em>Watchmen</em> in relation to our history. So, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at the spoiler-free Wikipedia synopsis:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Watchmen is set in an alternate reality that closely mirrors the contemporary world of the 1980s. The primary difference is the presence of superheroes. The point of divergence occurs in the year 1938. Their existence in this version of the United States is shown to have dramatically affected and altered the outcomes of real-world events such as the Vietnam War and the presidency of Richard Nixon. In keeping with the realism of the series, although the costumed crimefighters of Watchmen are commonly called &ldquo;superheroes&rdquo;, only one, named Doctor Manhattan, possesses any superhuman abilities.

In fact, without having had the trade paperback in front of me while watching I could still tell that much of Alan Moore&rsquo;s gritty dialog and story beats are translated almost directly from the comics to the screen with some streamlining by screenwriter J. Michael Straczynski (<em>Babylon 5</em>, <em>World War Z</em>, <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em>). <em>Watchmen</em> is very character-driven, so a lot of time is spent with a focus on said characters. However, it is the comic’s more fleshed out dialog in which we get a larger sense of the world of Watchmen that appears to have been trimmed. A simple truth illustrating the differences between the comic and animation mediums is that what we do get in terms of texture and detail is often lost in the flow of the motion picture as we are unable to linger on panels and soak in the additional context that the comics allow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Documenting all the little changes would take me a lot more time than I am willing to invest. Suffice it to say that the changes do not, as of yet, necessarily detract from the story and help to frame the necessary pacing for the motion-based medium versus the static page while maintaining the overall story arc of the first five issues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Character design is, due mostly to the 3D CGI, smoother and slightly less textured than the meticulous art of Dave Gibbons (illustration and lettering) and John Higgins (colorist). The positives, however, are that there are no speech bubbles to obfuscate the visuals, the view is wider than in the comic panels, and we can see the body language of characters in motion. One early illustration of the differences is when Dan Dreiberg (Nite Owl II, voice acted by Matthew Rhys) comes home to find Rorschach (Walter Kovacs, voice acted by Titus Welliver) has broken into his front door and is eating cold beans straight from cans in his kitchen. Rorschach&rsquo;s iconic pattern shifting mask is pulled up above his nose revealing the lower half of his face. In the comics, he clearly hasn&rsquo;t shaved in days and has baked bean sauce on his chin where in the film he&rsquo;s clean-shaven, as shown in the comparison below. This is a nitpick, but it&rsquo;s indicative of some of the visual sanitization of the adaptation, likely for budget reasons and/or time constraints. For now, however, that remains speculation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tknblogs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/watchmen-scene-comparison-2024.jpg\" alt=\"LEFT: My 2005 copy of Watchmen, RIGHT: The same scene in the 2024 film.\"></p>\n<p>The comics are laid out by Gibbons in a perfect grid of three by three rectangular panels, only deviating to group into larger panels or , less often, divide them even further into smaller ones, but always maintaining the pureness of 90º angles.

				"content_text": "![Series art for Chapter I featuring (Left to Right) The Comedian, Dr. Manhattan, Ozymandius, Rorschach, Silk Spectre II, and Nite Owl II.](https://tknblogs.micro.blog/uploads/2024/watchmen-chapter-1-v1-fmjpg-ux10002172404626.jpg)\n\nWhat can I say about *Watchmen* that hasn't already been said... is what I would say if DC hadn't just released the first part of an animated two part adaptation of what is considered one of the finest comic books of all time. But let's talk about the comic book first.\n\nReleased as a 12-issue limited series in 1986 and rendered into a trade paperback combining all twelve issues in 1987, the creation of writer Alan Moore, artist Dave Gibbons, and colored by John Higgins, *Watchmen* was a critical and commercial success and has remained so since its release. It would win a [Hugo Award in 1988](https://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1988-hugo-awards/) and be added to [Time Magazine's 100 All-Time Best Novels list](https://entertainment.time.com/2005/10/16/all-time-100-novels/slide/all/).\n\n<!--more-->\n\n> ***For more details regarding the Watchmen comics, please refer to the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen).***\n\n{{< youtube \"nSdg36526qU\" >}}\n\n[Zack Snyder's 2009 adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(film)) was something of a critical success, but in no way a commercial one. On a \\$150 million dollar budget it only pulled in \\$187 million at the box office, or in other words a commercial flop. A Director's Cut would be released later in 2009, but that would only increase the film's appreciation amongst critics and would not contribute to the studio’s bottom line in any significant way. A decade later, HBO would release [Damon Lindelof's *Watchmen* TV series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_(TV_series)) which would, like the comics, receive wide critical praise and commercial success and currently has a 96% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. However the show would differ significantly from the comics taking place thirty four years after the events in the comic books and focusing on racist violence in modern-day Tulsa, Oklahoma, the location of the tragic [Tulsa Race Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre) in 1921.\n\n## DC’s struggle with feature films\nDC is not known for making good live action adaptations of their comic book characters, aside from the Batman movies. I won't go into details, but I'll list a few: *Steel*, *Catwoman*, *Constantine*, *Superman Returns*, *Jonah Hex*, *Green Lantern*, *Man of Steel*, *Suicide Squad*, *Justice League*, *Shazam!*, *Black Adam*, *The Flash*, and *Blue Beetle* are most of their releases in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), and none of them performed well when compared to Marvel’s blockbuster run. There is, however, one medium in which DC has excelled and Marvel has not; animation. Their animated films, generally referred to as the DC Animated Universe, or DCAU, are produced by Warner Bros. Animation studio.\n\n> ***For a complete list of all DCAU animated films released, [check the Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_based_on_DC_Comics_publications#Theatrically_released_films).***\n\nFrom 1993's *Batman: Mask of the Phantasm* to the just released *Watchmen Chapter I*, DC has floated a literal armada of top-notch animated features. Sure, there have been duds like the unfortunate adaptation of the already unpopular comicbook, *Batman: The Killing Joke*, the 2nd and 3rd installments of the three part *Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths* film trilogy, and *Superman/Batman: Apocalypse* but there have been a lot more highly rated outings like *Batman: Under the Red Hood*, *Justice League: Doom*, the sublime *Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Parts 1 & 2*, and *Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox*. There are many, many more out of the near 60 films so don't feel bad if I'm leaving off one of your favorites. I’ve already listed a lot of films, so let's just move on to *Watchmen Chapter I*.\n\n> **Editor’s Note**: While DC has had an enormously successful run of animated features, the medium of animation in America has been relegated to the juvenile markets. There are pockets of successful adult animation, like *Family Guy* and other animated sit-coms and sci-fi like *Scavengers Reign*, but on the whole, animation isn’t taken seriously in the US. \n\n## The breakdown\nNow, normally for a review of an animated film, television show, or short I would not go through the history that lead up to that property's release, but *Watchmen* is different. Since it hit comic book shop shelves in 1986 and hasn’t been developed into a continuing franchise of any significance. I suspect a lot of our younger folk born since 2000 may not be as familiar with the comics as with older readers and an overview is helpful to understand the significance of *Watchmen* in relation to our history. So, let's take a quick look at the spoiler-free Wikipedia synopsis:\n\n> ***Watchmen is set in an alternate reality that closely mirrors the contemporary world of the 1980s. The primary difference is the presence of superheroes. The point of divergence occurs in the year 1938. Their existence in this version of the United States is shown to have dramatically affected and altered the outcomes of real-world events such as the Vietnam War and the presidency of Richard Nixon. In keeping with the realism of the series, although the costumed crimefighters of Watchmen are commonly called \"superheroes\", only one, named Doctor Manhattan, possesses any superhuman abilities. The war in Vietnam ends with an American victory in 1971 and Nixon is still president as of October 1985 upon the repeal of term limits and the Watergate scandal not coming to pass. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan occurs approximately six years later than in real life.***\n>\n> ***When the story begins, the existence of Doctor Manhattan has given the U.S. a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union, which has dramatically increased Cold War tensions. Eventually, by 1977, superheroes grow unpopular among the police and the public, leading them to be outlawed with the passage of the Keene Act. While many of the heroes retired, Doctor Manhattan and another superhero, known as The Comedian, operate as government-sanctioned agents. Another named Rorschach continues to operate outside the law.*** [[SOURCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen)]\n\n## The fundamentals\nThe film lines up quite neatly with the comics. *Chapter I* covers the first five books of the twelve book series and the opening scene is almost a shot-for-shot, word-for-word adaptation of the opening pages.

The one machine which has Windows 10 is a Dell Venue 8 Pro which needs a dongle to install another operating system, and I need to find the dongle. Once I find the dongle, Windows is gone, gone, gone. Why would I go through so much trouble getting rid of Windows?</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>In short, mostly Windows 11 and that I'll have to pay to get support for Windows 10 in October of 2025, but also everything Microsoft is doing now that is clearly anti-consumer. Let's dig into the demonstrable reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft has added advertising to the interface and start menu. There are also ads in Bing and in your desktop news feed. <a title=\"Link: https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/24/24138949/microsoft-windows-11-start-menu-ads-recommendations-setting-disable\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/24/24138949/microsoft-windows-11-start-menu-ads-recommendations-setting-disable\">Most articles regarding this \"feature\" explain how to disable them</a>. How long will we be able to disable the ads? I paid for a computer. I want to own it, not pay rent on top of a \"deposit.\" And in the latest insult, <a title=\"Link: https://www.techradar.com/computing/windows/microsoft-has-gone-too-far-including-a-game-pass-ad-in-the-settings-app-ushers-in-a-whole-new-age-of-ridiculous-over-advertisinghttps://\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/computing/windows/microsoft-has-gone-too-far-including-a-game-pass-ad-in-the-settings-app-ushers-in-a-whole-new-age-of-ridiculous-over-advertisinghttps://\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">they've now added advertising for the Game Pass subscription to the Settings</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft has been increasing the level of deep integration with their own services and resources. <a title=\"Link: https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/tech/microsoft-teams-eu-antitrust/index.html\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/tech/microsoft-teams-eu-antitrust/index.html\">The European Union is fining Microsoft $3 billion for bundling Teams and Office with Windows 11</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft has been diving head-first into the AI \"revolution\". While AI may be Artificial, it is far from Intelligent. Microsoft doesn't care though, since it's the new \"hotness\" and the shareholders need to be kept happy. <a title=\"Link: https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/microsoft-build-2024-windows-ai-operating-system-copilot-plus-pcs/\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/microsoft-build-2024-windows-ai-operating-system-copilot-plus-pcs/\">As such keyboards get a Copilot key, Windows gets Copilot features, and new ARM-based computers like the Surface Pro Copilot+ tablet are designed around AI</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Recently, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/microsoft-build-2024-windows-ai-operating-system-copilot-plus-pcs/\">Microsoft was going to be releasing the AI-powered </a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/microsoft-build-2024-windows-ai-operating-system-copilot-plus-pcs/\"><i><strong>Recall</strong></i></a><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/21/microsoft-build-2024-windows-ai-operating-system-copilot-plus-pcs/\"> feature which takes screenshots of everything you do everywhere and has been referred to by security experts as \"commercial malware\", but after significant backlash from almost everyone, they've delayed the launch</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-windows-10-support-ends-you-have-5-options-but-only-2-are-worth-considering/\">Microsoft is ending support for Windows 10 in October 2025</a>. And if you have a system that has been proven to easily run Windows 11, but isn't officially supported you are shit out of luck. You either pay for ongoing support, live without getting security updates, or stop using it and buy a compatible device. This isn't a great look for one of the wealthiest corporations in the World. It's a greedy look, especially for people who can't afford to drop $1,000+ on a new PC. At the very least, it's tone deaf AF.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/microsoft-reopens-beta-program-to-test-new-features-for-windows-10/\">Microsoft has reopened Windows 10 beta channels</a> and will start adding some Windows 11 features into the older system, despite them ending support for the platform next year. And by \"new\" features, it likely means AI, ads, and more tracking. And don't forget, Microsoft is still selling your data, and you're paying them for the privilege.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/operating-systems/windows-11-market-share-declines-as-users-seemingly-shift-back-to-windows-10\">Users are so unhappy with Windows 11 they are reinstalling Windows 10</a>, again despite Microsoft ending support it in 2025, which is likely what prompted Microsoft to start development of Windows 10 again (See above). Hey Microsoft, here's a Pro Tip: If your users feel like their operating system isn't letting them be productive and switch back to a previous version, maybe what you're doing isn't working.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555371/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-hardware-requirements-tpm-response\">Microsoft has made Windows 11 hardware requirements incredibly restrictive</a>, meaning you cannot install it on anything but the more recent CPUs and requires TPM, so that limits installation to mostly Intel and AMD systems with integrated TPM, or requires the installation of a TPM 2.0 module into desktop systems like gaming machines. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22644194/microsoft-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-processors-changes\">And it's not like older machines are incapable of running Windows 11</a>. While better security is always better, and TPM 2.0 definitely provides that like Apple did with Secure Enclave years ago, these choices by Microsoft and Apple still leave a lot of working computers to be relegated to the landfills, since only a small percentage end up going to collectors or are redirected to groups which repair older computers for people who can't afford to buy their own.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are organizations in various parts of the US that take donations or older computers, refurbish them, and sell for cheap or donate them to families in need. One fantastic resource is</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://digitunity.org/our-programs/aftrr/aftrr-map/\">Digitunity's AFTRR location map</a></p>\n<p>which lists US and Canadian organizations that take computer donations, refurbish them, and provide them to people and families in need. Another resource is the</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://impactful.ninja/best-charities-for-tech-computer-recycling/\">list of organizations at Impactful.Ninja</a></p>\n<p>, which is up-to-date as of 2024. If you have more resources, comment on this post to let me know and I'll add them if they check out :)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/26/us-mac-market-share-q1-2024/\">Due to the overwhelming success of Apple's shift to their own ARM architecture for all of their systems</a>, the rest of the industry is starting to follow suit, including Microsoft. If ARM takes over the overall marketplace for personal computers, the only operating systems you'll be limited to on older x86 systems that are still viable will be unsupported Windows and Linux, as well as a few other lesser known platforms (i.e., BSD, Haiku, RISC-OS). And if you've invested in Microsoft-compatible software, you can kiss that all goodbye unless you buy into Microsoft's subscription model.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/windows-11-tablet-users-get-ready-to-relearn-everything\">Microsoft has consistenly removed more and more tablet functionality since the Windows 8 redesign debacle</a>. While Windows 8 was terrible, it worked fantastic on tablets, including Microsoft's own Surface devices. Many of the tablet gesture functionality remained in Windows 10, and Microsoft still makes Surface Pros, but they are less and less \"tablet\" computers year after year. What's even the point anymore?</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/gateway/windows-11-is-making-it-absurdly-difficult-to-change-br-1847510904\">M</a><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/gateway/windows-11-is-making-it-absurdly-difficult-to-change-br-1847510904\">icrosoft has made it unpleasantly difficult to switch default applications, most egregiously Edge</a>. And there are some things that, no matter what you do, will still open Edge, making the selection of another default web browser a farce, at the very least. This alone makes the computer you've paid for not feel like it belongs to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-clamps-down-on-windows-11-users-who-want-local-accounts-but-this-trick-still-works/\">You can no longer use a Windows 11 system with a local-only account</a>. Microsoft now forces you to login using a MIcrosoft account. This isn't a thing on any other operating system, even macOS. While I don't think this applies to most users, if there are a few who don't want to have a Microsoft account to use their computer, that should be their choice.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The Start Menu and Taskbar and far less functional than in Windows 10 and earlier Windows systems since at least Windows XP. <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/539183/windows-11-review-an-unnecessary-replacement-for-windows-10.html\">Mark Hachman's review of Windows 11 features two major problems with the redesign, and they are the Taskbar and Start Menu</a>. Despite being from 2021, these problems have only gotten worse due to several unpopular changes and the addition of advertising.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-may-try-to-block-third-party-customization-apps-in-windows-11-24h2/\">Customization options for Windows 11 are dwindling</a>. Third party support is being leached away. There's no more Action Center, a feature of Windows 10 that became very popular. Bing is featured, and it's not a popular search engine and it now highlights AI summaries. That News sidebar thingy that's full of ads, advertorials, and questionable \"news\". Sorting in the file manager is weird. Context menus throughout the system are weird.<a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/switched-to-windows-11-and-miss-windows-10-features/\"> So much is unnecessarily weird, and people aren't happy</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Finally, there's decreasingly little one cannot do on a Mac or Linux machine with the same or equivalent applications or through web apps. In other words, users no longer need Windows to do anything but the most bespoke of tasks that require Windows. Sites like <a href=\"https://switching.software/\">Switching.Software</a> and <a href=\"https://alternativeto.net/\">AlternativeTo.net</a> help you easily find replacement apps instead of being chained to Windows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am, first and foremost, a Mac guy. I've been using Apple computers since the early 80's, and my first full-time Mac was an Apple PowerBook 145b in the early-90's. When I started writing professionally in the late-90's I'd added a PowerMac 7300/200 and a Newton MessagePad 130 to my stable. Despite my technical editing and revision contracts were predominantly for Windows books, I used my PowerMac to run Windows 95 and 98 in Connectix's Virtual PC to complete my work, and never once disappointed an editor (except when I missed deadlines, of course). It was a potent combination for the time.</p>\n<p>In the early 2000's I started fiddling with Linux, taught myself how to build my own system based on Caldera's OpenLinux using internet resources and, using a Packard-Bell desktop running Citrix MetaFrame, served Windows apps to my Linux desktop over our home network. I ended up cruising on Macs and Linux machines almost exclusively through to 2011 when my MacBook Pro was stolen from a Starbucks.</p>\n<p>It was quite the blow. And I had begun to be disenchanted with Apple at that time, so I dove into the PC ecosystem and Windows 7. I then struggled through Windows 8 until Windows 8.1 and 3rd party utilities improved it, then migrated to Windows 10 when the betas became stable. But in recent years, Microsoft has been backsliding from many of the advances they'd made during the Windows 10 era.</p>\n<p>Then Windows 11 was introduced when Microsoft had strongly suggested that they were doing to drop the number scheme and just keep updating Windows continuously. That alone made people upset, but in the beginning it was much like Windows 10 with a new desktop experience that was... novel.</p>\n<p>It didn't take long for that novelty to start wearing thin, however. Microsoft dropped the ball on a number of exciting projects like the Surface Duo, yet another in a long line of mobile device flops they've attempted following their initial success in the 2000's, and the Hololens, their mixed reality headset that was supposed to usher in a new age of computing, but is now only available for enterprise customers. <a href=\"https://www.versionmuseum.com/history-of/discontinued-microsoft-products\">In fact, Microsoft has bombed on a shocking number of projects over the years</a>.</p>\n<p>Ultimately it is the general air of disrespect and disdain for users that is wafting from Redmond in 2023-2024 that has finally irretrievably soured me on Microsoft. While I dislike absolutes, I find it highly unlikely that Satya Nadella will turn make significant changes to the plan he's been ushering in, at least not without facing down a sizeable consumer backlash that will threaten stock prices and spook investors.</p>\n<p>I guess we'll just have to wait and see if it comes to that.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>I came across the following article on Apple Insider a few days ago and was initially enthused. I'd recently written a quick guide to a freeware tool for the Mac called <i>Spaced</i> and was hoping to find some more gems to get my menu bar under even more control. It turned out to be little more than an advertisement for Bartender, a paid app. </p>\n<p>So, I've decided to write my own guide instead and this post has no paid anything. It's <i>all</i><i> freeware.</i></p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<h1>Using the basic menu bar</h1>\n<p>The macOS menu bar already has some in-built functionality for management of the icons added by the system, and many apps add icons to the menu bar upon installation. Let's run through the basics first, then we'll get into adding freeware to help you add some additional functions. </p>\n<h3>Moving icons</h3>\n<ol><li>\n<strong>CMD+CLICK</strong> on the icon you want to move. The icon will dim and stick to your mouse pointer.</li></ol>\n<ol><li>Drag the icon to the position you want it to stay. Like the Dock, the other icons will make room as you move the icon around, giving you space to drop it.</li></ol>\n<ol><li>Release the mouse button. </li></ol>\n<p>The vast majority of menu bar icons can be organized in this way, but some are reserved by the system. Those are <i>Control Center, Siri, and Date & Time</i>. Those three always remain all the way to the right end of the menu bar.</p>\n<h3>Removing icons</h3>\n<ol><li>\n<strong>CMD+CLICK</strong> on the icon you want to remove. The icon will dim and stick to your mouse pointer. </li></ol>\n<ol><li>Drag it away from the menu bar. </li></ol>\n<ol><li>When the \"Ⓧ\" appears next to the mouse pointer, release the mouse button. If the icon cannot be removed, you'll see \"🚫\" and it will jump back to where it was when you grabbed it when you release the mouse button.</li></ol>\n<p>While the menu bar does behave a bit like the Dock, it also does not. There's no Applications folder from which you can drag icons back to the menu bar. These functions are generally found in the options for various apps which offer menu bar icons or in the macOS Settings app for the various functions (i.e., wifi, Bluetooth, sound, etc.) Most of these, however, are handled by the <strong>Control Center</strong> which I cover in detail in the next section.</p>\n<blockquote><i><b>Editor's Note</b>: It is both difficult to take screenshots of these actions and to find a \"nope\" symbol that is an emoji and isn't red or a very small wingding. Sorry if it looks weird!</i></blockquote>\n<p>Try to keep track of the apps that you remove menu bar icons for so you can turn them back on if you change your mind. You might also want to make sure that menu bar icon isn't actually helpful before you discard it. Optionally, you can remove it from the apps options panel so you've at least seen where the setting is should regret set in. </p>\n<h3>The Control Center</h3>\n<p>Apple knows that the menu bar can get crowded after a while, which I am sure is the reason they added the <strong>Control Center</strong> to macOS. On my desktop, it looks like this:</p>\n<img src=\"https://beta.appflowy.cloud/api/file_storage/408cc120-bd9a-4c69-a665-b34df0edfeeb/blob/11392565471928234723.png\"><p>If you want to add a Control Center item to your menu bar, simply click and drag it over. You don't need to hold the CMD key. Adding a Control Center widget to the menu bar does <i>not</i><i> remove it from the Control Center, so if at some point you want to remove it from the menu bar, it will remain avaiable in the Control Center. </i> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<b>NOTE</b><i>: You can also control the Control Center and where widgets appear in  > System Settings... > Control Center. Options are </i>Don't Show in Menu Bar, Show in Menu Bar<i>, and for some, </i>Show When Active<i>. There are also additional modules you can add to either location, such as Fast User Switching or Accessibility Shortcuts.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unless I've missed something, that's pretty much it. So, let's move on to the next level... enhancements.</p>\n<h1>Enhancing the basic menu bar</h1>\n<p>You <i>can</i><i> buy a few utilities to make your menu bar more functional, but I'm going to focus entirely on freeware solutions. The first utility is one I've already written about. You can find details about that utility in the following post:</i></p>\n<p>In short, you combine the menu bar's in-built organization features with the<i> clonable spacers of </i><i>Spaced</i><i> to effectively replicate Bartender's most visible feature. </i></p>\n<h3>Hiding menu bar items</h3>\n<p>Next we have <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066?mt=12\"><strong><i>Hidden Bar</i></strong></a> from Dwarves Foundation. Not only is it rated 4.5, #40 on the top 100 utilities list, and an Editor's Choice, it's entirely free. It's also simple to use, as illustrated in the image below. </p>\n<img src=\"https://beta.appflowy.cloud/api/file_storage/408cc120-bd9a-4c69-a665-b34df0edfeeb/blob/15634742094822612837.png\"><p>Using what you learned earlier about how to move icons around the menu bar, any icons you place to the left of the widget will be hidden away, either automatically after a set time or manually. The settings are as follows:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Start Hidden Bar when I log in</strong> - The standard fare for utilities. This option launched the utility when you boot or reboot your machine so it's always running. </li></ul>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Show preferences on launch</strong> - This is helpful while you're getting it set up. You can uncheck this when you're ready. </li></ul>\n<blockquote>\n<b>TIP</b>: <i>To access the Preferences when you've disabled this option, right click on the section bar \"|\" when Hidden Bar is expanded. You can also toggle the auto collapse feature and quit the app entirely from this menu.</i>\n</blockquote>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Use the full menu bar on expanding</strong> - I'd suggest you leave this off. When on, instead of expanding in the background and still showing the active app's menus, it switches to Hidden Bar's menu giving more room for more icons since Hidden Bar only has one menu. I presume this is helpful is you have a ludicrous number of icons on the menu bar, your apps have lots of menus, or you are using a MacBook Pro with a notch, none of which I have, so I can't say. </li></ul>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Enable always hidden section</strong><strong> - Unless you have icons you rarely need to access or see, you can leave this off. If you can, it's better to just turn off the menu bar option for these apps or utilities. When enabled, however, an additional section is added to the Hidden Bar area, as shown in the image below. Any icons moved to this section appear when you right-click the icon. </strong>\n</li></ul>\n<img src=\"https://beta.appflowy.cloud/api/file_storage/408cc120-bd9a-4c69-a665-b34df0edfeeb/blob/9358964248458029837.png\"><blockquote>\n<b>NOTE</b>: <i>Right clicking the Hidden Bar icon acts as a toggle between showing and hiding the Always Hidden section</i>. </blockquote>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Automatically hide icon after </strong><strong>- You can choose from 5, 10, 15, and 30 seconds, and one minute. As it states on the tin, Hidden Bar collapses itself when you've left it alone for the selected period of time. </strong>\n</li></ul>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Global Shortcut</strong><strong> - If you'd like to have keyboard access to the icons you have in Hidden Bar, you can enter your own shortcut but clicking </strong><strong>Set Shortcut</strong><strong> and pressing a key combination, i.e., CTRL+OPT+CMD+H. This works like left-clicking the Hidden Bar icon, but does not have an option for showing Always Hidden icons. Do note, however, that clicking Set Shortcut gives no feedback until you press keys.</strong>\n</li></ul>\n<p>And that's pretty much that. With two free utilities and the in-built menu bar management tools of macOS, you've basically recreated the functionality of Bartender. </p>\n<h1>Changing the appearance of the menu bar</h1>\n<p>As you might have noticed in my screenshot in the Control Center section, my menu bar doesn't look like the standard menu bar that ships with macOS 14 \"Sonoma\", and for good reason; it's not. That's because I use <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lickable-menu-bar/id6444217677?mt=12\">Lickable Menu Bar</a>, a freeware utility available on the App Store. It's a simple utility that doesn't even bother with a menu bar icon. </p>\n<img src=\"https://beta.appflowy.cloud/api/file_storage/408cc120-bd9a-4c69-a665-b34df0edfeeb/blob/4123788574752713924.png\"><p>The only thing this utility does is allow you select one of three older versions of the menu bar's appearance, and in my case I have a preference for the menu bar of macOS Mavericks. It's also rather self-explanatory. </p>\n<p>When you first run the app you'll see the settings dialog above. Simply click the theme you like, and the changes are made instantly. Make sure to check the <strong>Launch at Login</strong> option for it to start automatically and uncheck the <strong>Show this window at launch</strong> option when you're happy with your selection. </p>\n<p>If you want to make a change after you've turned off the dialog, just launch the app again and the setting dialog will appear. If you want to stop using it, you can either uninstall it by dragging the app to the Trash or uncheck the <strong>Launch at Login</strong><strong> option and quit the app using the app menu or the \"Quit\" button in the lower right corner of the dialog. Easy peasy. </strong></p>\n<h1>Some honorable mentions...</h1>\n<p>While the following utilities don't modify or enhance the menu bar itself, they do add useful functions to the menu bar. </p>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>WhatsOn - Now Playing</strong><strong> [</strong><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whatson-now-playing/id1136082516?mt=12\"><strong>App Store link</strong></a><strong>] - WhatsOn is a very simple menu bar utility that tells you what's playing in Apple Music. This is quite nice since the desktop notification doesn't last that long and Music may be minimized to the Dock or hiding behind another window. Clicking on it gives you access to controls and album art and details. </strong>\n</li></ul>\n<img src=\"https://beta.appflowy.cloud/api/file_storage/408cc120-bd9a-4c69-a665-b34df0edfeeb/blob/6912591768095425862.png\"><ul><li>\n<strong>ClipTools </strong><strong>[</strong><a href=\"https://macmost.com/cliptools\"><strong>Website link</strong></a><strong>] - </strong>This free utility from MacMost.com makes your Mac's clipboard into a powerhouse and, unlike the other apps in this post, this one is not available in the App Store. It remembers everything you've copied, allows you to save specific clips for quick pasting, and lots of other functions. The only downside to the utility is that it does not store copied images. So, if you copy an image and then copy some text, you will not find that previously copied image in the list of clips. If, however, you use your clipboard a lot, this is a must have.<strong> </strong>\n</li></ul>\n<img src=\"https://macmost.com/wp-content/uploads/ClipTools2.jpg\"><h1>The takeaway</h1>\n<p>The menu bar appears to be a very simple tool in a rich and capable operating system, but it can be much more than that. It's nice to know that there are plenty of freeware apps and utilities which can quickly enhance how the menu bar works. </p>\n<p>And speaking of Freeware, I'll be adding more apps to my macOS Freeware series soon, and the next one will likely be one of my latest obsessions and the tool I am currently using the write my blog posts; <a href=\"https://appflowy.io/\">Appflowy</a>. </p>\n<p>If you have any suggestions for additions to this article or other freeware for macOS please comment below. I read all comments. I don't get many, so it's not hard 🤣</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>\n<br><br><p></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

It was quite nice to get a handle on my Mac's menubar. But I was paying $10 a month for <a href=\"https://setapp.com/\"><i>SetApp</i></a> and access to their library of around 240 applications and utilities. I could have purchased <i>Bartender</i> for $16 instead, but I didn't. I paid <i>SetApp</i> $240 for two years to end up using about six apps. </p>\n<p>That's not a value in my book.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>So, I cancelled my subscription and started looking for an alternative, and I found it in the form of <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spaced/id1666327168?mt=12\"><i>Spaced, </i></a><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spaced/id1666327168?mt=12\"><i>an entirely free utility available on the App Store</i></a><i>. Now, truth be told, </i><i>Bartender</i><i> is really nothing more than a menubar management tool that makes it easier to put your icons where you want them (mostly, as there are some restrictions imposed by macOS itself), add spacing, and easily hide items. I'm not attempting to diss </i><i>Bartender</i><i>, but it's way more than I need. </i></p>\n<p><i>Spaced</i> really only offers one of the functions of <i>Bartender</i>, adding space, hence the name. Now, macOS already makes it super easy to rearrange your menubar. Just <strong>CMD+Click</strong> on any item and drag it to a new location, excepting the Clock, Siri, and Command Center icons to the far right. </p>\n<p>When <i>Spaced</i><i> is running you won't see it at first as it will appear as a blank space at the left end of your menubar icons. Click that blank space, and you'll get the menu from which you can select a few options as shown below. </i></p>\n<img src=\"https://beta.appflowy.cloud/api/file_storage/543ece0e-568b-460d-8c93-b2245886b301/blob/8238123392149463118.png\" title=\"Image: https://beta.appflowy.cloud/api/file_storage/543ece0e-568b-460d-8c93-b2245886b301/blob/8238123392149463118.png\"><p>The first thing you'll want to do after installing <i>Spaced</i> and launching it for the first time is go into <strong>Settings... </strong>and turn on <b>Launch at Login</b> so the app starts when your system does. If you end up using one of the visible spacers, you can select the <b>Reduced Opacity</b> option to dim them and make them less... opaque. </p>\n<img src=\"https://beta.appflowy.cloud/api/file_storage/543ece0e-568b-460d-8c93-b2245886b301/blob/17337964712645519506.png\"><p>Following that you can start adding spaces by selecting the New item at the top of the menu. You can choose from a few options as to which kind of space you want to add:</p>\n<ul><li>Space - a single space</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Tab - a wider space</li></ul>\n<ul><li>• - a small bullet</li></ul>\n<ul><li>° - a large bullet </li></ul>\n<ul><li>| - a pipe</li></ul>\n<ul><li>- - a dash</li></ul>\n<ul><li>— - an emdash</li></ul>\n<p>Clicking the <strong>New</strong> item adds another copy of itself on the menubar. You can even click on any one of them and change the space for each spacer at will or add a new spacer. Once you've added a few spaces, you can <strong>CMD+Click</strong> to drag that space into a new position. Then just reorganize your menubar items into groups that are logical to you. I've arranged mine as shown in the following image. </p>\n<img src=\"https://beta.appflowy.cloud/api/file_storage/543ece0e-568b-460d-8c93-b2245886b301/blob/12343643656041559631.png\"><p><i>Spaced</i><i> is a very tidy little app, an applet if you will. It consumes no real CPU power and very little RAM within the context of Macs that can ship with 8GBs of RAM (and I have 16GBs on my M1 Mini 2020) as you can see in the image below. </i></p>\n<img src=\"https://beta.appflowy.cloud/api/file_storage/543ece0e-568b-460d-8c93-b2245886b301/blob/10998942499621838908.png\"><p><strong>PROS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Simple</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Easy to learn</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Free</li></ul>\n<p><strong>CONS</strong></p>\n<ul><li>The App Store version is only for macOS 14 \"Sonoma\". <a href=\"https://sindresorhus.com/spaced#older-versions\">For an older that works with macOS 13 \"Big Sur\", visit the developers website</a>. </li></ul>\n<h3><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h3>\n<p>Simply put, this simple app is the simplest invocation of simplicity. It does a single job and does it well, and all without fanfare or added complexity. Spaced may be free, but I find it's utility priceless, and if the developer wants to share their work with others, who am I to say no. <br></p>\n",

If you want to get the basics of the concept, then you should go read that first. It’s not a long piece and I’ve linked it below. I do outline a few ideas there, but there needs to be some additional context so that you might fully understand the power that I believe resides both in the $1 bill and in the people who are tired of always being on the bottom of the economy, even if you <em>only</em> have a few million dollars in the bank, an amount that is nowhere near as comforting as it was a decade or two ago.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tylerknowsnothing.com/saving-the-internet-for-humanity-dollarnomics-101\" title=\"Link: https://tylerknowsnothing.com/saving-the-internet-for-humanity-dollarnomics-101\">Saving the Internet for Humanity: Dollarnomics 101</a></p>\n<p>Here in this second part, I will be outlining how certain groups and/or organizations would pay benefit from $1 a month per subscriber revenue, and attempt to show how that would be significantly transformative to said groups and/or organizations. Note here that by ‘groups and/or organizations’ I am referring to developers, services, brick & mortar stores, entertainment, and most anything else. There are some limitations that would manifest for certain organizations that need more substantial infusions of capital, for instance space programs, governments, and large multi-nationals, but this is a concept designed for regular, every day folk and groups which have organic communities. It will become clear through the following examples.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A Twitter Clone</strong> - I think this particular case would be an easy choice for most people, aside from those who are giddy with joy that <em>the service formerly known as Twitter</em> is now a hot mess. Twitter, for all its faults, was a powerful resource for local, regional, state-wide, and national news. I would happily pay $1 a month for a Twitter clone that did not have advertising of any kind and did not collect and sell my personal data. To make it even more useful, I’d leave reactions, but remove interaction, which is a significant cause of conflict on most social media platforms. I’d also add UP/DOWN voting so the users democratically decide what gets floated to the top and what doesn’t get traffic. It may not be a perfect solution, but it would be a damn sight better than Elon Musk’s combination train wreck/dumpster fire. Based on <a>Statista numbers of Twitter users worldwide in 2022</a> before Musk bought it that October, the service that popularized the term “tweet” had amassed nearly 397 million users. If only 10 million users pay $1 a month, that would be $10 million dollars in monthly revenue.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The LA Times</strong> - I am a native Californian. I was born in Pasadena. Aside from the years I spent splitting time between parents, and thus to and from Pasadena and Knoxville, TN., I’ve lived the vast majority of my life here. I find local news to be critical, and while the LA Times is a local paper, it has global reach. I would, and I believe millions of my fellow Angelenos would happily pay $1 a month for the news. That doesn’t mean the LA Times needs to stop selling ad space, but the venerable newspaper wouldn’t need to lean on it as a crutch, and it also relieves the pressure from said advertisers. For instance, if LA Times investigative reporters were to produce a powerful article unveiling a dark side of some corporation that is harming citizens and they pull their advertising, the LA Times itself would likely not feel the effects of the loss of revenue. In fact, I believe it would increase the public’s trust in them as a news organization, and also increase $1 subscribers. <a>According to the LA Times About Page</a>, they have <sub>40</sub> million website visitors, 1.6 million Sunday Edition readers, and a combined 4.4 million weekly readers. If all digital subscribers were switched to $1 a month plans that would likely draw a lot more paid subscribers. A current digital subscription is going for $98 a year, 53% off the normal $208 rate. How many people do you think are willing to pay that? With 14 million peeps in the LA Metropolitan Area, 10% of them would net them 1.4 million a month. I imagine the subscribership would be a lot larger.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Far Too Many Musical Acts To List</strong> - Ok. I’ll list a few. Bruce Hornsby, Rush, Level 42, Toto, Progger, Big Wreck, Jason Falkner, Rob Fetters, MUTEMATH, Simple Minds, Echo & The Bunnymen, Simon Phillips… oh dear. I’m gushing, but I think my point is made. Who do you love listening to and would also love to contribute to their continuing ability to make more of what you love? That’s a lot of love, I think. While I don’t have any statistics on any of these bands, you likely know that Rush and Toto are huge North American acts, and the rest have sizable followings. Let’s say, for example, that the extraordinary Rob Fetters (The Raisins, The Bears, Psychodots, and five solo albums) that you seriously need to listen to, has 25,000 fans who are happy to pay $1 a month to help him put on his live shows on YouTube. That’s $25,000 a month of consistent, reliable revenue. I’m willing to bet he has far more fans. Rush and Toto alone could likely count on millions of fans each. Could you imagine what Taylor Swift could do if her fans contributed? She could likely set up her own tours, handle her own ticketing, and get out from under the yoke of Big Media. Without the so-called ‘middle-peeps’ involved, groups could define their own fate instead of relying on the “good will” of record labels, agents, ravenous ticketing monsters, and other blockades to their creative freedom.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Independent App/Game Developers</strong> - One of the first indie game developers that comes to mind is Daisuke “Pixel” Amaya who single-handedly created the legendary freeware game <em>Cave Story</em> over a period of five years. Another well-known solo developer is Robert “Toby” Fox, the creator of <em>Undertale</em> and <em>Deltarune</em> who, despite being a prolific creator, suffers from hand and wrist pain. Both of these creators and many, many more solo and small team developers who have fans around the world would benefit from some baseline stability in the form of $1/mo. support from those fans. On the software side, Gary Rosenzweig, the founder and principal contributor of MacMost.com and developer of the freeware ClipTools for macOS is able to do what he does without serving ads because of his Patreon supporters. He currently states he has <sub>1</sub>,500 subscribers, but if he were to switch to $1/mo. I believe he could multiply his subscriber count by several factors.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Open Source Application Developers</strong> - The vast majority of open source apps are developed in the spare time of the developers and, as is standard practice for open source, available for free. Making an open source project successful is far more difficult than starting a rock band and getting a record contract. These developers often ask for donations, but very few people donate as the expectation is for more substantial sums. The reality is, however, that lots of people don’t have the ability to make larger donations off-hand, and even if they could said larger donations would only last so long. The goal needs to change from size of donation to consistency of a large number of small, predictable donations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Mozilla</strong> - Yes, the peeps who make Firefox. For years, the Mozilla Foundation has relied on revenues from its partnership with Google for being set as default search engine, a relationship many understand is designed to help Google avoid antitrust liability. The reasoning being that if there is at least one competitor, Google <em>can’t</em> be a monopoly. Of course, Google seriously overpays Mozilla to make sure that the open source organization is beholden to them for operations, but with a voluntary $1/mo. from each willing user, just <sub>40</sub> million users paying in would make that arrangement unnecessary, or at least allow Mozilla to negotiate much better terms for itself. I realize that’s a lot of peeps to get that done, but it wouldn’t have to be quick to have a positive impact on Mozilla, their products, and their users.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>YouTube Creators</strong> - Don’t get me wrong. I think YouTube creators should be paid for their efforts. Unfortunately, YouTube itself seems to hate them. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tAfaXFIcuvc\">Watch this video from Second Thought, a verified YouTube creator, who covers much of what’s wrong with YouTube, and I think you’ll understand</a>. These creators have to work themselves to the bone and hope that YouTube’s algorithm actually works for them and they earn some of that sweet ad sharing money. Seriously, watch the video. All will become clear. If, however, 10% of Second Thought’s subscribers gave him $1 a month, that would be approximately $170,000 a month in revenue. Consistent. Repeatable. These are things YouTube has trouble with, and it’s driving creators away.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Writers Like Myself</strong> - I won’t hammer on this as I don’t think this needs additional exposition. Do, however, check out my Ko-Fi page linked on the homepage. Even if you are also a writer, check it out to see how simple the setup is and do your best to emulate it. Even a few hundred contributors would likely change the lives of most independent writers, and that only costs each subscriber $1 a month.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Completely Free WordPress Themes & Plugins</strong> - The once promising universe of WordPress assets has turned to utter crap over the past decade. Just poke around their themes and plugins and you’ll find loads of downloads that are handicapped versions you can “unlock” with payments to “Go Pro”. For someone who just wants to blog or start a simple website, it’s a field of endless “Pro” landmines. And even if you go for the free version, most add persistent or frequently appearing promotional ads in an attempt to convince you to upgrade. Automattic, the company that created WordPress, is clearly unwilling to place any limits on theme or plugin developers or even bother to curate their own resources to make it easier to find completely free options. I would happily pay $1 a month to get curated access to verified resources that are completely free of any upgrades, passing along the bulk of the subscription income to the creators of the resources as an incentive to keep feeding the ecosystem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using a no-fee service like <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com\">Ko-Fi</a> or <a href=\"https://liberapay.com/\">Liberapay</a> you can get the most out of each donation without much overhead or the parasitic middle-man, aside from processor fees which no one can escape (whee).</p>\n\n<p>I’m going to leave it at this for now. These exemplars should be more than enough to derive plans for other applications. Next will be a completely new spin on user security and the simplification of the user space of the internet. Don’t worry, despite sounding complex, it’s dirt simple. </p>\n",

They hide away under the folds of my mind, deep in the shadows, keeping as silent as death. My ability to search for them is limited, so I try my best to shine light into those darkened box canyons of brain tissue, but words are not bound by the laws of physics and my feeble light is obscured by a thick fog. The multi-verse is popular these days, so I imagine that words exist in their own pocket universe and they can control when and where the two realities intersect, allowing me to access them again, but only for a short time.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>I try to force myself to create new words when the ones I seek refuse my peace offerings and woeful cries for respite. This piece was born of that method. Here, now, I sit trying to push the words out of my mind and onto the page, but it is a painfully laborious process that taxes my attention and enthusiasm.</p>\n\n<p>Enthusiasm. What even is that any more?</p>\n\n<p>Back in late January of 2020 before the world was fully aware of the threat that was dragging it’s lumbering carcass from the depths of the microscopic reality that lives alongside us humans, I was struck with the then-unnamed viral horror. To make it even worse, I was still in the throes of my first bout with Shingles. I was wreaked with pain, but suffered none of the lung-related afflictions. My wife and daughter both joined me on this unwanted journey, and we were lucky, though we didn’t know nor care at the time.</p>\n\n<p>Before that, the words frolicked about like puppies in a field of flowers. I could do little to stop them, but I would catch a few and give them a lot of personal attention until I would present the trained and groomed product to the internet for general consumption. Then the new decade came and ended all of that. From thence, I watched as the light, cool air and clear blue skies faded into a shadowed wasteland studded with dark, foreboding chasms of blackness impenetrable to the eye or thought… or hope.</p>\n\n<p>I am reminded of the closing stanza of <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42891/stopping-by-woods-on-a-snowy-evening\">Robert Frost’s famous poem</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   \n \nBut I have promises to keep,   \n \nAnd miles to go before I sleep,   \n \nAnd miles to go before I sleep.\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There exists a caveat, however. The woods I am in are not lovely and I hope that there may be an opportunity for me to leave them soon. And when I do sleep, I hope to awaken to a new dawn in which I am restored and whole. </p>\n</div>\n",

I blog on PostHaven, which is a wonderful blogging service you should definitely check out if you hate the Technogarchy, would like to adhere to a reasonable budget, and appreciate actual ethics. Here's a short list of the tools I'm using to achieve something of a social media presence:</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b><a href=\"https://posthaven.com\" target=\"_blank\">PostHaven</a></b> - As I said above, it's a blogging service that costs $5 a month and allows for ten blogs, each of which can have it's own personal domain, but by default uses a subdomain of posthaven.com something like Tumblr or Medium. They've committed to building a service that will last at least 100 years and add a sweet twist; if you maintain your account for one year, they will keep your blogs online forever. If you miss a few months the worst that will happen is you won't be able to post until you make a payment. Read up on it. It's a really great deal. One handy feature is Autopost which sends my latest to LinkedIn and Twitter.</li>\n<li>\n<b><a href=\"https://getdrafts.com\" target=\"_blank\">Drafts 5 for Apple</a></b> - Sorry Windows and Linux users, this one is a strictly macOS/iOS/iPadOS/Watch app. If, however, you use Macs, it's $20/year for the Pro version which turns the app into a beastly tool for writing. With a simple global shortcut it appears and I can just start typing. In default mode, it creates a new draft every fifteen minutes giving you a clean sheet every time to capture thoughts and ideas quickly. I turn this off since I can just create a new draft with the universally standard **⌘+N** keyboard shortcut. This allows me to keep one draft up while I'm actively working it. When I'm done, I use another keyboard shortcut to fire off the Mail Draft to PostHaven script and can complete the post in the PostHaven web editor. When posted, it then Autoposts to Twitter and LinkedIn. </li>\n<li>\n<b><a href=\"https://ifttt.com\" target=\"_blank\">IFTTT (IfThisThenThat)</a></b> - Twitter now sucks and LinkedIn isn't exactly a hotbed of activity for blog posting, so IFTTT comes in handy. If you are unaware, it's a web-based no-code automation tool that allows you to integrate hundreds of web services that don't natively talk to each other. While there is a heavy focus on home automation tools and services, IFTTT does have a load of connections to other helpful services and tools. With PostHaven only autoposting to LinkedIn and Twitter, I use IFTTT to take my RSS feed updates and send new posts to Facebook, Tumblr, and Mastodon, making a total of five places links for my post appear. Prices range from Free to $2.50/mo. for Pro and $5/mo. for Pro+, all rather reasonable if you ask me. </li>\n</ul>\n<br>If you're into blogging, don't need a hosting plan, dislike what WordPress has become, would prefer to work with ethical companies and small developers, and don't want to drain your likely beleaguered bank account, this setup is very usable and affordable. <br><br>There are a few caveats, however. One big one is the PostHaven web editor. It's functional for just about any writing and can even take HTML code, but the editor window is small, which makes editing in situ a grind. Drafts 5 allows me to bypass this with a desktop editor and has the side-effect of keeping drafts of all my posts which then gets backed up to my NAS. <br><br>Another caveat is that Drafts 5 does not have any image or media support. While this isn't terrible, it means I have to add any images to my posts in the PostHaven editor. I'm still working on ways to get around this, or at the very least, make it easier to manage. Finally, IFTTT is subject to changes in the APIs of the services it supports requiring edits or rewrites to the no-code code to make it work again. Related to this is that LinkedIn periodically requires re-authorization for connections, but PostHaven tells me when this happens so I don't consider it a caveat. Just a periodic annoyance. <br><br>If you do use Linux (good) or Windows (bad) then everything but the Drafts 5 part will work for you, and PostHaven's email posting can be leveraged from a number of apps, like Obsidian... I believe. I haven't confirmed this and I'm lazy, but I think this feature is available. I might just do a write-up on how to do this from Linux, since I don't use Windows any more. At all. On anything...<br><br><div>That said, I still have work to do to make sure everything is working correctly, all the formatting is readable, and, most importantly, I'm happy with the results. I do feel that I'm on the right path, however. I truly hope that, in 2024, <a href=\"https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/pub/guide-for-activitypub-users\" target=\"_blank\">ActivityPub</a> takes off and that it will ease some of the pains of the loss of old, borked Twitter.

Apple Notes is a wonderfully capable notes app that allows you to bulk import all manner of rich text file formats, even entire Evernote exports, and organize them the way you like... with one exception. If you want to stop using Notes, you have to leave everything you created in Notes behind, or export them one by one. </p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>\nI have over 300 notes. \n</p>\n<p>\nThis is not only annoying but terribly wrong of Apple. I shouldn't have to explain why. I didn't spend a few thousand dollars on Apple gear to lose control over the data I create. I have personal notes, drafts of articles, detailed project concepts, musings, recipes for loads of gluten-free foods, and a bunch more categories. And now that I'm not using Apple Notes anymore... er. No. That's not right. Now that I don't use Apple Notes anymore I am forced to keep it around in order to retain all that material I generated or saved from various web pages. <br></p>\n<p>I am now using Drafts (<a href=\"https://getdrafts.com/\" target=\"_blank\">$20/year on the App Store</a>), also known as Drafts 5 for iOS and iPad, which has been around for a very long time, from what I understand. Using the app, I can see why. It's a powerfully fast and capable notes capturing tool that allows me to create a new note with a simple keystroke so I don't lose the bright spots of inspiration that, today, seem to fritter away all too quickly. In a 24-hour period I've already created thirteen notes with over 2,000 words combined. <br></p>\n<p>There is, however, nothing I can do about all the notes I have in Apple Notes since the damnable thing won't let me grab them all wholesale. If I can offer any advice, it would be to not engage Apple's Notes app for any reason because if at any point you need to get them out, you will not be able to do so without spending a load of personal time exporting them to PDF... the only export option. </p>\n<p>Unacceptable, Apple.

All Rights Reserved. </i><a href=\"https://www.dustyabell.com\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Dusty Abell is a comic artist</i></a><i> who has pencilled countless comic books, is an illustrator, and has been involved in the animation industry as a character designer since 2000.

The series, produced by Paramount Television and both commissioned by and broadcast on NBC, had its moments with episodes that broke critical new ground, like the first inter-racial kisses in Season 1’s introduction to Khan Noonien-Singh, “Space Seed,” and the more frequently cited kiss between Kirk and Uhura in Season 3 episode “Plato’s Stepchildren.”</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>Then there were other episodes that kicked down granny’s door, broke her fine china, and peed in the foyer. Some common examples are from the third season, the premier called “Spock’s Brain,” and two weird “ensemble antagonist” episodes, a gaggle of space hippies in “The Way to Eden” described by Grace Lee Whitney (Ensign Rand) as a “clinker” and a throng of amnesiac tweens mind-controlled by a used car salesman generously blended with<em> </em>the ghost of a megachurch preacher in “And the Children Shall Lead”.</p>\n<p>Series creator, Gene Roddenberry, clearly had luck on his side. NBC paid to have a pilot made and didn’t like it, but made the unusual decision to commission a second, which would become the <em>Star Trek</em> we know today. That luck, and an “organic” fan write-in campaign, would get them through a cancellation threat in the middle of the second season, but a second “organic” campaign would fail, and <em>Star Trek </em>was cancelled during the third season.</p>\n<p><em>Star</em> <em>Trek </em>however would go on to become quite popular in syndication, something I can directly attest to as I was a young lad in the 70’s. The intense popularity would prompt Roddenberry to team up with Filmation to create an animated series that ran on Saturday morning for twenty-two episodes over two seasons in 1973 and 1974. Later, the animated series that was broadcast also as <em>Star Trek</em> would become known as <em>Star Trek: The Animated Series</em>, and would represent the unofficial fourth and fifth seasons of <em>The Original Series,</em> at least according to the most devoted Trekkers/Trekkies.</p>\n<p>It wouldn't be until 1979 that <em>The Motion Picture</em> would propel <em>Star Trek</em> from the syndication juggernaut it had become into an honest-to-goodness, multi-format franchise.</p>\n<blockquote>Let’s slow our roll a bit, my peeps. If I were to detail the development and production of ST:TOS, this article would take you a few hours to read. Instead, I’ve outlined a rough sketch of events sufficient for you to have context. If you’d like to know more about the history of Star Trek, check out the Wikipedia pages where there is an embarrassment of content, including entire pages for each episode of every series. At the very least, peruse the pages for <strong>The Original Series</strong> and <strong>The Animated Series</strong>, as those tales are fascinating. -Ed.</blockquote>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek\"><strong>Star Trek - Wikipedia</strong><br><em>Star Trek is an American science fiction media franchise created by Gene Roddenberry, which began with the eponymous…</em>en.wikipedia.org</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek\"></a>\n</div>\n<h3>The adventure begins… again</h3>\n<p><em>Star Trek: The Motion Picture</em> managed mixed reactions from fans and critics alike, often noting that it lacked in traditional action set pieces and contained far too many special effects shots, a concept that seems alien in 2022. It turns out that the film was based on an episode of a cancelled <em>Star Trek: Phase II</em> series expanded into a feature film, which might explain why there are many long, experiential sequences that pad the run-time. It’s difficult to get two hours of story out of a teleplay meant to fit into a one-hour time slot. Despite this, fan interest was quite strong. The film made enough at the box office to warrant a sequel, and that turned out to be just what the struggling franchise needed. What came next would become one of the most beloved films of all time, <em>Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan</em>.</p>\n<p>That simple twist of fate which brought together the right people at the right time to create something that astonished and delighted fans of the original series would form the new foundation of an epic theatrical run and almost enough energy to spin <em>Star Trek</em> into four new TV series. Each series would be less popular than the last with <em>TNG</em> and <em>DS9</em> battling for most beloved, but only <em>TNG’s </em>crew shifted to cinematic releases, bowing with 1994’s <em>Star Trek: Generations</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> We Trek fans love our acronyms. For the remainder of this article I will be referring to each series by its acronym. The general rule of thumb, if you’d not noticed yet, is ST for Star Trek followed by a colon, then an acronym from the series title, like so: <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> (<em>ST:TNG</em>), <em>Star Trek: Deep Space 9</em> (<em>ST:DS9</em>), <em>Star Trek: Voyager</em> (<em>ST:VOY</em>), and <em>Star Trek: Enterprise, </em>which didn’t get a catchy acronym that would stick. As such, the original series would be <em>TOS</em> or <em>ST:TOS</em> and the animated one, <em>TAS</em> or <em>ST:TAS</em>. In context, you drop the <em>ST:</em> to leave the remaining unique identifier. -Ed.</blockquote>\n<p>Paramount weren’t just twiddling their thumbs following the end of <em>TAS,</em> as they would release four theatrical films over the next seven years, 1979’s <em>Star Trek: The Movie, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em> in 1982, <em>Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</em> in 1984, and <em>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</em> in 1986. The first four films primarily focused on the <em>TOS</em> cast, but also started roughly sketching out the <em>Trek</em> universe, establishing many of the rules, the foundations of the United Federation of Planets, and relationships between the races, both complementary and contentious. You know, world building.</p>\n<p>Energized by the popularity of <em>ST:TOS</em> in syndication and the first four feature films, <em>Wrath of Khan</em> and <em>Voyage Home</em> proving to be box-office blockbusters, Paramount began to develop a new television series that would become <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>. Unhappy with the offers from ABC, CBS, and NBC and passing on an anemic offer from the newly minted FOX network, Paramount instead opted to retain full control, offering <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> to independent stations under a barter syndication contract known as First-Run Syndication.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>An explanation of Barter Syndication excerpted from the </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>TNG Wikipedia entry</strong></a><strong>:</strong> The stations sold five minutes of commercial time to local advertisers and Paramount sold the remaining seven minutes to national advertisers. Stations had to commit to purchasing reruns in the future, and only those that aired the new show could purchase the popular reruns of the <em>Original Series</em>.</blockquote>\n<p>For the new show, the <em>TNG</em> production team developed a more refined version of the episodic format established by <em>TOS</em>, where episodes would show a crew working together to solve problems through the lens of current events and cultural sentiment of the time, many of the themes being universally familiar. Far more than a mere monster-of-the-week format, Roddenberry wanted to create a universe where interpersonal conflict was a thing of the past, establishing in the production bible that crew mates weren’t guided by greed, lust, or power, opting instead for a more congenial fellowship.</p>\n<p>The first season didn’t go well. Many of the writers from <em>TOS</em> were producing scripts that didn’t fit into Gene’s ideals and, as a result, Roddenberry reportedly “rewrote” the first fifteen episodes of the first season so they would adhere to his rules. Critics were unimpressed. <em>DVD Journal</em>’s Mark Bourne said at the time, “A typical episode relied on trite plot points, clumsy allegories, dry and stilted dialogue, or characterization that was taking too long to feel relaxed and natural.\" Patrick Stewart’s acting was applauded, however, and a number of key serial story arcs would be introduced, as well as some of the series’ most iconic recurring characters such as the god-like Q and Data’s evil twin brother, Lore.</p>\n<blockquote>“A typical episode relied on trite plot points, clumsy allegories, dry and stilted dialogue, or characterization that was taking too long to feel relaxed and natural.”</blockquote>\n<p>Following a debut season that would have seen a lesser property cancelled, <em>TNG</em> would go on to become one of the most influential television shows of all time and establish the tone and values for the next two decades of <em>Trek</em>.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div><hr></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>From 1987’s launch of <em>TNG</em> until the premature cancellation of Enterprise in 2005 <em>Star Trek</em> was kind of a big deal. Some Trek luminaries regularly graced the pages of gossip rags, People, TV Guide, and other media outlets of the time, filled with glitzy paparazzi photos and talk about coming episodes. <em>TNG</em> had transitioned to feature films rather seamlessly with First Contact being the block buster it was and the hype around the new Trek for a new millennium.</p>\n<p>2002’s <em>Star Trek: Nemesis</em>, the fourth film in the <em>TNG</em> run, didn’t do well, however, and the franchise would go mostly dormant for another seven years before J.J. Abrams 2009 <em>Star Trek</em> introduced a new take on the characters from <em>TOS</em>. Not only did “JJ” (I’m not typing those periods every time, people) bring a whole new style and tone to the franchise, but would create a new alternate future-history with the so-called <em>Kelvin Timeline</em>.</p>\n<p>This radical departure from established canon had two significant effects. One, clearly unhappy with the retro-future chic of i, JJ dragged NCC-1701 “Enterprise” far, far, FAR into the future, one of the principle hallmarks of the reboot. This also had an unintended effect. When Paramount was seeking to reinvigorate the Trek TV franchise for their new streaming platform in partnership with CBS (now Paramount+) they leaned into the esthetic that JJ brought with the films, kickstarting the multi-season debacle that is <em>Discovery</em>, but I’ll get to that soon enough. Two, it kicked the original canon to the curb in favor of a more bombastic, action-oriented approach helmed by a collection of actors portraying, albeit excellently, caricatures of the beloved characters they were reprising, while lacking much of the nuance and “humanity” that Kirk, Spock, Bones, Scotty, Uhura et al. brought to the table through all of the films.</p>\n<p>JJ’s 2009 <em>Star Trek</em> would use the Trek wireframe, but fill it with action set pieces and coded witty banter designed to stereotype the characters to whom they were supposedly paying homage. American audiences ate it up like so much candy and, as it is in today’s Hollywood, two more films were made, neither of which were very good. Certainly gorgeous and packed to the gills with action set pieces, but still lacking any of the true soul of <em>Star Trek</em>.</p>\n<h4>So, what IS Star Trek?</h4>\n<p>Well, one thing Trek is <em>not</em> is any <em>one</em> thing. I’m not great with philosophy. To make this easier on me, watch this fantastic video from Wisecrack, a YouTube channel that discusses all manner of things through the lens of philosophy.</p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>Sorry to give you homework, but this piece is already going to cost you 20 minutes. Besides, how terrible is a nice video interlude, really.<p>The one thing that Jared (you should watch the video, seriously) glossed over was the fact that no one ideology rules anything. Even if the Borg were to exist, they would not be able to create an entirely homogeneous universe from end to end. In canon, the “Q” would likely stop them, as we “lower” beings, at the very least, provide the Q some modicum of entertainment, while recognizing that change in inevitable.</p>\n<p>Take the Borg Queen as an example. She is, in a very real sense, a singular force who has her own wishes and desires and she obsesses over them to the point of her own destruction, as we see in <em>Star Trek: First Contact</em>. She presented as an avatar of absolute dictators like North Korea’s Kim Jung Un, an individual who, through a force and terror structure handed down to him by his progenitors, decides the fate of every single soul living within the borders of “his” country.</p>\n<p>And yet, if <strong>this</strong> was the root of what makes <em>Star Trek</em>, then the Borg would be the only antagonist to face the Enterprise crew, backed by the ideals of The <em>Federation of Planets</em> and its all-encompassing <em>Prime Directive</em>. No, <em>Star Trek</em> is so, so much more, as through 700+ episodes of TV and a bevy of feature-length films (minus JJ’s works) we see depictions of just about every ideological stance humans have invented as seen through it’s own lens; humanism.</p>\n<p>Trek, then, imagines an egalitarian future that is not free of crime and sorrow and violence, but one that responds to those things with restraint and understanding and, as necessary, force. Does <em>Star Trek</em> represent a true utopia? Of course not. As with the Borg, it’s simply not possible. Living beings, regardless of how well we might be able to work together, will always have differences, and from that will spring all manner of conflict, and we all know what happens when there’s conflict. Unresolved conflict eventually leads to violence. Always…</p>\n<h4>But there’s more…</h4>\n<p>Trek isn’t just a platform for developing thesis around philosophy. There are more esoteric aspects of the functional aspects of how Pre-Abrams Trek was produced. The easiest way to illustrate that is with a bullet list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Tolerance</strong> — the bridge crew in <em>TOS</em> included a Russian… DURING THE COLD WAR. The aforementioned black+white kiss happened on <em>TOS</em>. In all things, the crews of Trek are tolerant until someone’s rights are being abused, at which point they tend to break the rules to make it as right as possible.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Empathy</strong> — the protagonists of Trek feel bad for others who are being hurt, but retain their human flaws. <em>TOS</em> Kirk wished for the death of the Klingon race after one Klingon killed his son, but he would later fight tooth and nail to save them. When one of the crew is taken over by a malevolent force, something that happens frequently, they don’t judge the individual for something they could not control. When they get a distress call, they rush to help. Caring for others comes first.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Logic</strong> — paramount to Vulcan culture is the suppression of their decidedly hyper violent emotional aspects to lean into logic, as cold and impersonal as it is. And yet, that doesn’t override the egalitarian humanism. It complements it. Kirk, Picard, Sisko, Janeway, and Archer had foils in the form of their bridge crews, each of which challenged their initial impulses with alternative views of the same events occurring in each episode. These captains would then distill their collective brain power into a string of decisions that would result in a desired outcome, typically one that would save or, at the very least, improve the lives of the people determined to be in need.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Technological Egalitarianism</strong> — not necessarily ideological in nature, the technology and science presented throughout the Trek universe, up until JJ Abrams took the helm, was an operational expression of critical thinking. Within the rules of Trek, the crews would work together to figure out a problem, determine the best course of action to correct it, and implement a plan to achieve the desired goal. This would often require the use or manipulation of some technological aspect of the Trek universe, and Trek production teams would use real scientists to paint at least a somewhat accurate scientific solution based on as much reality as possible. There were, in almost no uncertain terms, any “magical” solutions that just worked without making some kind of sense. Some episodes slipped. Nobody’s perfect.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Individualism, not Socialism</strong> — Contrary to popular belief, a Trek future is not one of Socialism but of empowered, cooperative individuals enabled by an egalitarian collective understanding. This can be illustrated by the simple fact that, when faced with a crisis, Trek Captains break the rules to do the right thing and, while they pay the consequences, they are never diminished as an individual. We see this most consistently in <em>Star Trek: Voyager</em> where Captain Janeway no longer has a direct connection to The Federation. And yet, despite the vast gulf of space between Voyager and Earth, the crew struggles to maintain the values of the Prime Directive.* This shows the audience that individuals, not socialist constructs, are the ultimate arbiters of applications of their own power. There are rules, but smart people know that there can’t be enough rules to satisfy all issues, so some of them must be bent on occasion.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>* Thanks for the inspiration, <a href=\"https://cameronharwick.com/blog/the-political-philosophy-of-star-trek/\" target=\"_blank\">CameronHarwick.com</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a impossible nutshell, Trek is… complicated, and it’s fiction that merely illustrates an imagined future where equality is paramount, life is sacrosanct, power is moderated, self is recognized, and about a billion other truisms. And yet, one ideal rises above all others; humanism. I must call it humanism because I don’t know a word that describes the same thing as applied to multiple sentient alien species. <em>Star Trek</em>, as a whole, does its damnedest to make everyone matter.</p>\n<h4>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Reboot…</h4>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Funny_Thing_Happened_on_the_Way_to_the_Forum\"><strong>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum - Wikipedia</strong><br><em>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by Burt…</em>en.wikipedia.org</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Funny_Thing_Happened_on_the_Way_to_the_Forum\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>Much like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Funny_Thing_Happened_on_the_Way_to_the_Forum\" target=\"_blank\">farcical Broadway show with a very similar name from 1962</a>, JJ’s <em>Star Trek</em> is itself a farcical take on the original canon, starting with <em>TOS</em> and ending with <em>Enterprise</em>. “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum” was inspired by ancient Roman farces and heavily flavored with vaudevillian antics.</p>\n<p>While the musical does lean into social commentary and satire, JJ’s intended his Trek to be a reintroduction of the <em>Trek Universe</em> to newcomers, according to Abrams himself. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_%28film%29\" target=\"_blank\">A read through the Wikipedia entry for the 2009 film titled simply <em>Star Trek</em> is telling</a>. The “Production” section is littered with casual Hollywood justifications for all of the changes made, and how JJ’s team just <em>knew</em> it would work to make the characters relatable and the story exciting.</p>\n<p>Never mind that these characters, established over fifty-plus years of material, had already been established, deeply relatable, and I’ll be damned if <em>Trek</em> wasn’t already exciting.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_%28film%29\"><strong>Star Trek (film) - Wikipedia</strong><br><em>Star Trek is a 2009 American science fiction action film directed by J. J. Abrams and written by Roberto Orci and Alex…</em>en.wikipedia.org</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_%28film%29\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>So, canon be damned, JJ and Co. decided to effectively toss everything nuanced and substitute common, work-a-day Hollywood tropes.</p>\n<p>I think it’s the dismissive insult of flippantly casting aside decades of work by hundreds of cast and crew to maintain canon spanning fifteen productions that bothers me the most. The universe of <em>Star Trek</em> is as rich, deep, and diverse as Tolkien’s <em>Silmarillion</em>, from which can spring an endless array of possible stories that would have thrilled and engaged moviegoers, but instead we were served an admittedly gorgeous extended episode of <em>Miami Vice</em> <em>in Space</em> packed stem to stern with eye-straining lens flares accompanying Michael Bay-inspired action set pieces. If, however, you watch it like watching a <em>Star Wars</em> movie, ironically or tragically the preferred franchise of JJ Abrams, it is a fun film.</p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p>The fun would end with <em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em>, though, as it would tackle rebooting the much beloved and revered character arc of one Khan Noonien Singh, utterly annihilating it in the process. Khan, now a white dude in the form of the otherwise brilliant Benedict Cumberbatch, is overwhelmingly unrecognizable, even when we learn his character’s true name and purpose. Nothing about <em>Into Darkness</em> resonates in any way, shape, or form with <em>Star Trek: Wrath of Khan</em> aside from the exceedingly clumsy tropes that were yanked from the original source material and turned into a “twist” at the end that again insults any and all fans with even passing knowledge of the landmark Trek film.</p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p><em>Star Trek Beyond</em>, directed this time by serial Fast & Furious helmer Justin Lin, is on an entirely different level of tangent as it features one of the largest structures ever built by the Federation, Starbase Yorktown, an impossibly huge, transparent behemoth that was clearly [pun alert] unrealistic in light of the fact that this is supposed to have been constructed during James T. Kirk’s early years in the captain’s chair and therefore, prior to events in <em>The Original Series</em>.</p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p>And if all this wasn’t enough, the mood around Trek was already darkened by the passing of screen legend Leonard Nimoy (<em>TOS</em> Spock) and that actor Anton Yelchin (who played a delightful Pavel Chekov) had been killed in a tragic vehicle accident a month before the film’s release.</p>\n<p>Despite positive critical and audience reviews, however, <em>Beyond</em> effectively bombed at the US box-office as it couldn’t hold up to pressure from <em>Jason Bourne</em> and <em>Suicide Squad</em>. It’s also quite likely that the decline in ticket sales was due to the existing fan base starting to have an increasingly bad taste in their mouths from the effects of JJ’s radical changes to canon. That sour taste would be the unwanted gift that just kept on giving as, a few years later, CBS and Paramount would start to spin up new streaming properties, starting with <em>Discovery</em> which would be the keystone to their line-up on the then shiny new CBS All Access, now re-branded as Paramount+.</p>\n<h3>J.J.’s Series of Unfortunate Events</h3>\n<p>Mirroring the excessively disastrous manner in which the blockbusting success of Christopher Nolan’s <em>Dark Knight</em> film trilogy would inform Warner’s DCEU with overly dark and brooding tones that weren’t appropriate for the IPs they were applied to, JJ’s <em>Trek</em> films and <em>Kelvin</em> timeline would inject a cancer throughout Paramount’s Trek productions, namely <em>Discovery</em>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Discovery\" target=\"_blank\">Read this excerpt from the Wikipedia entry for the series</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<em>The series begins around ten years before the events of </em>Star Trek: The Original Series<em>, when Commander Michael Burnham’s recklessness starts a war between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire. She is court-martialed, demoted, and reassigned to the USS </em>Discovery<em>, which has a unique means of propulsion called the “Spore Drive”. After an adventure in the Mirror Universe, </em>Discovery<em> helps end the Klingon war. In the second season they investigate seven mysterious signals and a strange figure known as the “Red Angel”, and fight off a rogue artificial intelligence. This conflict ends with the </em>Discovery<em> traveling to the 32nd century, more than 900 years into their future.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<em>The USS </em>Discovery<em> finds the Federation fragmented in the future, and investigates the cause of a cataclysmic event known as the “Burn” in the third season. Burnham is promoted to captain of </em>Discovery<em> at the end of the season, and in the fourth season the crew helps rebuild the Federation while facing a space anomaly that causes destruction across the galaxy.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a life-long Trekkie, this reads like the fever dream of a nine year-old who watched a few episodes of <em>TOS</em> for the first time while playing with crayons while binging on Mountain Dew and Ho Ho’s. The thing that frustrates me the most however is the “Spore Drive”, a magical solution which, like the improbability-powered <em>Heart of Gold</em> from Douglas Adams’ satirical and hilarious <em>Hitchhiker’s Guide to The Galaxy</em> books, allows the titular <em>Discovery</em> to instantly jump anywhere, just with more accuracy and fewer fantastical, physics-defying side effects (like turning into couches or being made of yarn until improbability normalizes.) And how, in a time occurring <strong><em>before</em></strong> the events of <em>TOS</em>, do they manage this? Why, with magical, space-breathing giant tardigrades, of course.</p>\n<p>I’m not kidding.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*goBuWZBzRwhknwVg\"><br>\n</div>\n<div>\n<blockquote><i>Yes, JJ. Magical space yeti bears. Seems legit.</i></blockquote>\n<p>In short, JJ’s ridiculously callous abandonment of the core values and world building established over 50 years of <em>Star Trek</em> canon on television, the big screen, books, comics, and video games transmogrified the franchise into a caricature of itself. Paramount clearly felt that the popularity of 2009’s <em>Star Trek</em> film meant that’s what people wanted to see for Trek’s future.</p>\n<p>I honestly don’t want to talk about <em>Picard</em>, as much as it pains me to say so. It’s just an expensive disaster of a show that learned everything from JJ and finally had to end with a 3rd season that both delighted and horrified long-time fans. The following article gives you a good rundown of the issues.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://screenrant.com/star-trek-picard-death-synth-resurrection-pointless/\"><strong>Picard's Star Trek Death Was Completely Pointless</strong><br><em>Star Trek: Picard killed off Jean-Luc in season 1, before a swift resurrection that had no bearing on season 2, will it…</em>screenrant.com</a></div>\n<h3>So, what now?</h3>\n<p>The original title to this article was going to end with “…and how to fix it.” It seems, however, that I don’t need to offer any suggestions. Paramount seems to have gotten the message.</p>\n<p><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> would kick off things in a very unexpected way in August of 2020, just as the Pandemic was kicking into first gear. As you can likely see, it’s animated, but it’s not for kids. It’s what is currently termed Adult Animation, as in <em>Family Guy, Rick & Morty</em>, and <em>BoJack Horseman</em>, to name a few, and yet it hews to canon and convention, if unconventionally. It’s well worth a watch.</p>\n<p>If that wasn’t weird enough, October 2021 would see the premier of <em>Star Trek: Prodigy</em>, this time for a younger audience and getting Kate Mulgrew to voice Captain Kathryn Janeway, the character she played for seven seasons of <em>VOY</em>. It is a surprisingly well written premise that explores their part of the universe following the same rules as a regular Trek series from a very unique perspective. It’s wonderfully fulfilling for humans of any age.</p>\n<p>Then, in a turn wholly unexpected, there came <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em>, which has brought an all new take to <em>TOS</em> and <em>TNG</em> style story telling with their heads firmly in canon. In all honesty, I expected to be treated to something akin to Discovery for SNW, but my wife and I were shocked, I tell you. From the first moment, the series has honored almost everything I ever wanted in a new <em>Trek</em> series since <em>Enterprise</em>, all while delivering a fresh, new spin on the episodic formula.</p>\n<p>And all without falling too far into the traps of JJ’s <em>Kelvin</em>-verse. Sure, the sets are phenomenal and appear far more advanced than <em>TOS</em>, but they’ve dialed out the magical clap-trap and the eye-searing lens flares to powerful and enjoyable effect.</p>\n<p>I won’t spoil any more. Just watch it.</p>\n<h3>The obligatory summary</h3>\n<p>There’s really not a lot to say, but thanks to all of the people working on the productions of Lower Decks, Prodigy, and SNW. Your love of the Trek Universe honors the fans who have come to love Star Trek over the past half Century.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I believe it’s important to deconstruct the things that break so we can understand <em>why</em> they break, or in this case, were broken.</p>\n<p>That pretty much sums it up.

Born in ‘68, I grew up in the thick of the consumer electronics and personal computer boom of the late 70's. Keeping to myself at times, loudly evangelistic at others, a shame-free Mac Ex-pat, reluctant Windows user for a decade, and always the staunch critic, my fandom runs deep. From my early experiences with Apple ][e machines, to all of the Macs I’ve had since, and arriving at now with the two Mac Minis on my desk, one an M1 and the other a last-gen Intel model, I have had my most satisfying and productive years on Macs.</p>\n<p>Fortunate for me that I missed Apple’s Butterfly Keyboard era, then.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<div><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design\"><strong>The saga of Apple's bad butterfly MacBook keyboards is finally over</strong><br><em>After the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, Apple has finally stopped trying to fix the butterfly keyboard on its laptops.

File a Claim, Key Dates, FAQs…</em>www.keyboardsettlement.com</a></div>\n<p>In a nutshell, the Butterfly keyboards on a range of Macbook, Macbook Pro, and MacBook Air models from 2015 to 2019 were atrocious (SEE: model list below). The fancy new keyboard failed far more frequently than the Magic keyboards that came before, and necessitated costly, complex repairs at Apple service centers to replace the parts, only for them to break again… and again… and again.</p>\n<p>At first Apple tried to ignore the problem away, likely thinking they could engineer themselves out of the corner they’d gotten themselves into with later revisions. None of the refinements made any lasting change, however. In the end, Apple offered all owners free fixes for up to four years from purchase, and then settled a Class Action lawsuit brought by a group of very annoyed owners. If you qualified, you’d get up to $395, which isn’t much of a consolation after spending a few thousand bucks (or more) on a laptop with a terminally faulty primary input device.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the debut of the temperamental technology also marked the triumphantly tragic return of a 12\" model, it’s first since the PowerBook G4 12\" from 2005. Because of Intel’s terrible low-power mobile chips of 2015 and the soon-to-be-unusable Butterfly keyboard, the 12\" was doomed before it even had a chance. 2016 would see the Butterfly brought to the foundational 13\" and 15\" MacBook Pro models, and two years later would see the failure-prone keyboard shoehorned into a significant refresh of the very popular MacBook Air. Later in 2019, Apple would restore the Magic keyboard for it’s final Intel machines and in 2020 would roll out the first of their Apple Silicon machines.</p>\n<p>The following is a list of models so you know which to avoid purchasing used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2015–2017: MacBook</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2016–2019: MacBook Pro</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2018–2019: MacBook Air</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>SOURCE</strong>: <a href=\"https://macsx.com/which-macbooks-have-the-butterfly-keyboard/\" target=\"_blank\">MacsX.com, <strong><em>Which MacBooks have the butterfly keyboard?</em></strong></a>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>What’s going to happen to all this potential computing power?</h3>\n<p>That’s the question, isn’t it? March 2023 is when Apple legally washed their hands of the whole affair. If you want the keyboard replaced now, you have to pay full fare of over $700… each and every time it fails. I doubt many will opt for this, and most, if not all, have likely already moved on to Apple Silicon models, now that Apple has nearly completed it’s transition away from Intel’s hot and anemic CPUs.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*b2pkWoVbOoxXtmwkHiPfxw.png\"><br>\n</div>\n<div>\n<blockquote><i>Apple still sells the last of the Intel-based MacBook Pros on Amazon for an eye-watering $2,800.

In other words, no soup for you.</i></blockquote>\n<p>We can speculate. Some have likely been packed in a closet in a fit of frustration at having to replace a machine that should have lasted years longer. Others will put them up for sale on eBay or similar sites and pass them on to some unsuspecting sap or, with a disclosure, at a steeply discounted price. Others could be donated or given away. I imagine, however, that a lot will eventually end up in a landfill or an e-waste facility.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>ASIDE</strong>: For the more creatively inclined, some might even be used to test gravity by throwing it out an open window. Also, please don’t. It’s likely illegal.</blockquote>\n<p>It’s a shame, really. While Intel’s mobile silicon consumes a lot of power, runs hotter, and offer significantly less run-time and performance when on battery compared to Apple’s M-series of chips (we’re now up to M3 as of October 2023) they are still very capable machines, that are only useful if you connect an external keyboard. It is patently absurd to me that countless thousands of otherwise functional computers where everything else works cannot be reworked in some fashion to facilitate many years of productivity they would otherwise not provide.</p>\n<p>I dislike, however, dumping on stuff without offering some suggestions for how said woes might be rectified, so here’re a few off the top of my head:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Engineer a replacement keyboard for these devices that works on a more reliable technology. Maybe take some inspiration from gaming portables like the Game Boy, which uses conductive rubber. It may not type very well, but it <em>will</em> type.</li>\n<li>Create an external case for the motherboard so it can be used as a desktop machine. Make one that includes the battery so it can be portable.</li>\n<li>Retrofit the displays from 15\" models so they can work as an external display.

It’s not like this is breaking news or a controversial hot-take, either. No need to sit down or get a stiff drink:</p>\n<p>Nobody, but <strong><em>NOBODY</em></strong> likes advertisements… except ad people.</p>\n<p>When I was working IT at Saatchi & Saatchi LA back in the mid-2000’s, Toyota was paying them tens of millions a year to make a handful of splashy national ads. Sure, they were epic, for ads, but all that money floated a five story building bursting with 500 worker bees that would pump out a half dozen ads a year.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>This is the kind of crap SSLA would spend their massive budget on. All this for a 30-second TV spot. This ad was made just before the Great Recession in 2008. I often wonder how many of the millions of starving children Toyota’s annual advertising budget could feed. Does Toyota even need to advertise anymore?<p>I’ve been thinking about this article for a long time, and my plan was to capture ads and break down how terrible they were. But I recently had a small epiphany; everybody already knows what they hate about advertising. I don’t <em>need</em> to tell you what you dislike. Instead, I’ll ask you a question.</p>\n<p>When was the last time you derived real, concrete benefits from an ad?</p>\n<p>Were you made aware of an amazing new product that you can no longer live without? Did you learn something important about a medicine that could save your life? Has anyone ever actually used J. G. Wentworth’s services? What the <em>hell</em> is grandma hiding?! How much time could you save per day if you didn’t have to bend over to put on your shoes??!!</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/media/google-reports-decreased-ad-revenue-amid-looming-advertiser-pullback/\"><strong>Google's Ad Revenue Is Down Amid Looming Advertiser Pullback</strong><br><em>Spending on both search and YouTube fell, and the company missed street estimates.</em>www.adweek.com</a><a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/media/google-reports-decreased-ad-revenue-amid-looming-advertiser-pullback/\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>If I were a betting human, I’d wager the vast majority of Americans just ignore ads. We block them on the web all the time. Google is apparently “hurting” from reduced ad revenues because of ad blockers. Zuckerberg’s Facebook has lost millions upon millions developing and advertising it’s VR thingy while at the same time playing politics with his American Edge Project spots on National TV.</p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div><iframe width=\"666\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D81uh6I-2Q4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Toyota Tundra See Saw\"></iframe></div>\n<blockquote><div><i>AEP stopped making their videos public eight months prior to the time of this publication. This is a common trend of late amongst advertisers. I imagine it reduces the potential vectors for trouble they have to manage from publicly accessible outlets like YouTube. The Comments section can be ruthless.</i></div></blockquote>\n<p>And if there’s any question about which organizations are providing the bulk of the funding, take a look at their about page (below).</p>\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*tuqfEFtQsaKtPpwKWzoGvQ.png\"><br>\n</div>\n<blockquote><div><i>Bear Hill is a private equity firm, Lexington Institute is a Koch-funded think tank that focuses on defense and national security, and the various Chamber of Commerce-related outfits are all-in on Capitalism. Then there’s Meta, or what used to be called Facebook. They claim their charter is to protect “American innovation”, but what innovation is going on in America, unless you consider the rapid increase in corporate acquisitions to be innovative. Mass consolidation does nothing more than funnel more power and money to the 1%.</i></div></blockquote>\n<h3>Advertising isn’t doing what it used to do…</h3>\n<p>In days long past, before the internet, we used to have three TV channels and a bunch of weird stuff on UHF. We used to read magazines and newpapers or listen to AM or FM radio. In all, we’d see and hear and read ads, and these ads would be targeted to the audience. And how would they know the audience?</p>\n<p>They’d ask people.</p>\n<p>Sure, I’m clearly glossing over the details which aren’t important to our discussion, but we had services that gathered useful, non-identifying data on what people were consuming. Then, of all things, companies would actually try something new to see what takes off. If it didn’t sell, they’d pull it, eat the cost, and move on to the next thing.</p>\n<p>We don’t do that any more. Now it’s all about Google and Facebook and others sucking up as much information as they can to parse out who you are, what you like and dislike, and then targeting you specifically. It’s freaking creepy as hell and it’s ludicrous. It’s not like, outside of digital media, companies can produce unique products for each and every person. The costs would be insane. It makes one wonder what the point is…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>The Short Answer</strong>: It’s all about manipulation, shaping ideas amongst large swaths of America, guiding the narrative. Fear is a powerful tool, and subtle, obtuse fear is even more so. For more on fear in advertising, read How Fear-Appeal Advertising Works from University of Melbourne’s Pursuit online magazine.</blockquote>\n<h3>Now it’s all just noise…</h3>\n<p>Humans hear noise all the time, whether we are aware of it or not. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaf_hearing\" target=\"_blank\">Even deaf people can “hear”</a>. After a while, we become desensitized to those noises that we find annoying. There’s little one can do to stop the source of the noise itself, unless you’re wealthy, of course. For those of us who are not wealthy, most of us have some capacity for tuning out such noise.</p>\n<p>This fact has long been recognized with respect to ad breaks on television. When’s the best time to go to the bathroom or get snacks and drinks? Why, the ad break, of course. And even if sit through the ad breaks, few people just sit watching the ads in rapture. Now, there’s the annual Super Bowl ad madness, but like other manufactured cultural touchstones, this non-event merely serves to aggrandize advertising.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.ceros.com/inspire/originals/super-bowl-commercials/\"><strong>How Super Bowl Commercials Became a Cultural Phenomenon</strong><br><em>As coaches and players hit the turf this Sunday, so do the many advertisers who have spent the past year strategizing…</em>www.ceros.com</a><a href=\"https://www.ceros.com/inspire/originals/super-bowl-commercials/\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>Of note, Super Bowl viewership saw it’s lowest numbers in 2019, and if that’s the pinnacle of American advertising, it seems to be losing steam.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://amt-lab.org/blog/2022/2/declining-super-bowl-viewership-will-it-maintain-most-watched-event-of-the-year\"><strong>Declining Super Bowl Viewership: Will it Maintain Most-Watched Event of the Year? - AMT Lab @ CMU</strong><br><em>While the Super Bowl has managed to remain the most-watched live event of the year, it has not managed to maintain its…</em>amt-lab.org</a><a href=\"https://amt-lab.org/blog/2022/2/declining-super-bowl-viewership-will-it-maintain-most-watched-event-of-the-year\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, we now block ads, and some web browsers now come with ad blocking technology integrated. We’ve learned to look for the “Sponsored” block at the top of Google searches, or we just use an alternative like <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com\" target=\"_blank\">DuckDuckGo</a>. Personally, I have a small selection of plugins I use in Firefox on Linux and Safari on macOS (see below), each of which have different properties and strengths, all designed to filter out the crap we just don’t want to see, hear, or read.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>SAFARI</strong>: AdGuard (subscription service), DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials, and Safari’s integrated content blockers.<br><strong>FIREFOX</strong>: uBlock Origin, DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials, and Firefox’s integrated Enhanced Tracking Prevention tools.</blockquote>\n<h3>If ads are dead, what now?</h3>\n<p>Not to put too fine a point on it, but the advertising industry as it is now needs a complete overhaul. But, as impractical as it is for corporations to create affordable, customized products for consumers, it’s equally so for advertising to simply disappear. It would leave a vacuum, but what’s filling that space now is utterly useless. So, here’s a list of some of the things I think can be done:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make the collection of personal information illegal. Not all forms of data collection are bad, however, so some specificity is warranted. What we’ve seen from corporate America, on the other hand, is distrssingly egregious. You will be reminded of this every time one of you are notified that one of your email addresses has been involved in a security breach. An Internet Users Bill of Rights spelling out exactly what corporations can collect from individuals would be a great start.</li>\n<li>The FCC should mandate that most internet, TV, and radio ads be restricted to ads local to the user or region, no exceptions. For the internet, this will require that ISPs give useful location data to advertisers. If you’ve ever been confused about why you’re seeing ads for Phoenix, AZ. when you live in Southern California, this is why. Besides, offering only local ads will give consumers leads on products and services they can actually take advantage of.</li>\n<li>Get money out of politics, specifically the ever-burgeoning budgets that are floating widespread campaigns filled with disinformation and outright lies that fill our TVs, websites, and mailboxes almost every year, depending on where you live. Money is not free speech. The average Joe or Jane can’t afford to run ads on CNN or FOX News. Very few individuals can. So, it’s back to what it should be: one person, one vote. Period.</li>\n<li>Develop an open source replacement for Craig’s List that can be run by municipalities and not some corporate entity. These used to be called Classifieds and you’d find them in your local newspaper. Classifieds can be used for all manner of things, like announcing your new companies Doing Business As (DBA) to satisfy requirements of a local operating license, announcing a yard sale for your neighborhood, sending someone a message, and… oh, anything posted on Craig’s List.</li>\n<li>Put a stop to spam emails, SMS, and calls. Sure, scams aren’t ads, but many are frequently designed to mimic the communications of major retailers in order to trick people into giving the scammers money. In short, theft.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don’t believe these are onerous or even difficult, but three out of the four I’ve offered need government support. Counting on Capitalism to fix these things is a fool’s errand. The elements that need FCC support require strong leadership, and I don’t see that in the FCC’s Agit Pai, a holdover from the Trump administration that doesn’t seem to be going away any time soon. And if laws need to be passed, well… Congress isn’t exactly passing many of those these days.</p>\n<h3>When in doubt, grassroots it…</h3>\n<p>What to do, then? It certainly seems bleak with everything that’s going on in this confused and terrifying world we’re experiencing. Fortunately for humanity we already have all the tools we need to make things better. We just need leaders to take on projects and build a coalition of helpers to make them a reality. It would sure beat spending all our time on Tik Tok or doom scrolling or whatever it is people waste their time on these days.</p>\n<p>Like me.</p>\n<p>The only tool in our toolbox that needs love, attention, and some sharpening is the will to do them. If it’s unclear, I’m speaking to myself, as well. While I face intense challenges (Long Covid in the form of brain fog and nigh constant exhaustion, the effects of a terrible motorcycle accident in 1990 that involves most of my joints, and lifelong depression) I can still write, but I often spend more time watching YouTube and Nebula, listening to music, and sleeping than penning new pieces. Just look at how few pieces I’ve posted here on Medium and how long I’ve had an account.</p>\n<p>No, it’s not going to be easy, but with will to make things real, humans can do anything, and right now one of those things needs to be fixing the internet.</p>\n<p>I think it’s killed enough of our children.</p>\n<p><em>PS: Yes, I dropped that mic.

It takes nigh on nothing to press a key, an advantage I’m sure is prized by gamers more rabid and entrenched than myself, but when I’m writing I’m forced to BACKSPACE to repair something that was rendered illegible every third or fourth word. So, I’m typing this review on my Dell tablet PC with a typecover-style input device, and my typing accuracy rockets back up to normal levels.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>I’m a touch typist in the loosest of terms. I taught myself, but not using normal methods, but through repeated familiarity of decades of writing on computers. That part of my life started in 1995 when I got my first laptop, a gift from a friend. It was an Apple PowerBook 145B and it’s keyboard is still utterly glorious. (Yes, I still have it.)</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, my $120 Logitech MX Keys for Mac gave up the ghost after two short years. As a professional nerd, I have a large collection of keyboards, so I pulled one out and looked for something new. After years of reading and viewing extensive plaudits from pundits showering mechanical keyboards in adoration, I decided it was time to try out something a bit more modular. There had to be something to mechanical keyboards, right?</p>\n<p>After all, how could millions of gamers be wrong?</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*kshkNXz8gmaBL0hZ_nI6Ig.png\"><p>The Keychron K5 SE is a very well built keyboard with a clean, attractive design. It supports macOS and Windows layouts and even supplies the key caps to facilitate the swap. To that end, they also include a combination keycap and switch puller. In Bluetooth mode, you can select from three different devices with a key combination or you can switch to USB mode for a direct connection.</p>\n<blockquote><strong>BONUS COMPLAINT: For some reason, Keychron chose to locate the Function (FN) key on the right end of the keyboard and integrated the Bluetooth selection keys with the 1, 2, and 3 keys. Logical, but now a forced two-handed operation instead of an easy one-handed move had the FN key been located to the left end, as most are. So, Keychron, stop that, please.</strong></blockquote>\n<p>It is supposed to be a low profile keyboard, but it’s also a mechanical one, so there exist limitations imposed by the technology alone. I get that, and it is quite thin, as you’d imagine, but to get that full, deep key travel, the stroke has to be rather long. As you can see in the image below, it’s not as low profile as a standard low profile typer.</p>\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*FrZyrrbFnj0ZewaQNIP5Hw.jpeg\"><br>\n</div>\n<blockquote><div><i>Yes. Each key cap travels almost entirely to the deck. These switches are referred to as “North Facing” as the LED light is only emitted towards the top of the keyboard, and not all the way around. The LEDs also shine up into the key caps and illuminate the legend. Those are called “Double Shot” keys because, I think, they inject one mold for the key and then another for the legend, using a translucent material. Clever. The LEDs appear blue in images, but are white.</i></div></blockquote>\n<p>It could be the decades I’ve been typing on Apple and laptop keyboards. It could be that I never took typing classes and have since relied on my own muscle memory. It could be that the spacing between keys or the type of switches I chose are to blame. I don’t know, and despite efforts, I’ve been unable to learn much more. And no, I haven’t asked a mechanical keyboard expert. I’m not even sure where I’d find one, outside of numerous YouTube channels.</p>\n<p>It’s not that it’s broken. It’s not. It works quite well, if it has some weird charging and Bluetooth issues on occasion, which facilitated my move to cabled USB mode. I also don’t use the Bluetooth switching mode. I had that on my MX Keys for Mac and used it for a good while, but kept forgetting to switch and would have to clean up the mess I’d create on another device. Additionally, I find the shocking orange keys to be neat, but somewhat clash with the clean two-tone grey of the rest of the keyboard.</p>\n<p>What I wanted was a new keycap set like the hundreds of varieties I’d seen for mechanical keyboards on eBay, Etsy, and Amazon. Some beautiful, others insane, even more just average, but lots and lots of options. It turns out, however, that low profile is not a common term in mechanical keyboard circles. I don’t know if it’s because they are unpopular or just a new concept, because trying to find keycaps is to find about a paltry smattering of options.</p>\n<p>Counting on Keychron to be helpful turned out to be an erroneous assumption. Combing through the site yielded little more than additional frustration as they only offer a handful of options <em>for their own keyboard</em>. Have a standard mechanical keyboard? You’re in luck, as they offer forty eight variations in stock and another fifty variants that are so popular they are sold out.</p>\n<p>No keycaps for you, I can hear Seinfeld’s Soup Nazi shrieking.</p>\n<p>Other than that, the switches I selected suck because I don’t know what to choose and all I’ve ever heard about these things is from the same voices telling me how amazing mechanical keyboards are. When picking the keyboard, I selected the Gateron Red switches because, as the following chart shows, they are supposed to be quiet.</p>\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*GVswpD4PkKJV52Z2\"><br>\n</div>\n<blockquote><div><i>If, to get a reasonable typing experience, I need to get the Gateron Blues, I don’t want them. These “quiet” Reds aren’t anywhere near quiet. I can only imagine how loud the clicky Blues are. Ugh…</i></div></blockquote>\n<p>In the end, all I can say is that I don’t like my mechanical keyboard. I don’t believe my dislike is predicated on some failure in design, a lack of quality, or any functional benefits that simply don’t favor my typing style. My fingers are apparently geared to prefer laptop-style, lower profile key that have decent travel, but nowhere near as much as a mechanical type. On a laptop keyboard, my fingertips glide over the surfaces of adjacent keys.</p>\n<p>I can’t do that on the K5 SE.</p>\n<p>I don’t know. I likely just have to give it time. It’s not like the damn thing is my only keyboard, but it’s one of the only ones of the many I have that I need to carefully position myself in front of and fingers on in order to get decent, less error-prone typing.</p>\n<p>Maybe someone can tell me which switches I should get!</p>\n<p>---<br></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/dollarnomics\" target=\"_blank\">If you enjoyed what you just read and would like to support be for $1 a month, click here for my Ko-Fi page</a>.</p>\n</div>\n",

What I didn’t know at the time was that kind of child-like joy and excitement in reaction to technology would last my lifetime.</p>\n<p>For my first Mac, a friend gifted me a PowerBook 145b, then later I purchased a PowerMac 7300/200 new, used a PowerBook “Pismo” for seven years thanks to a G4 upgrade card, added a top spec 15\" PowerBook G4 for a few years, followed by migration to an Intel 15\" MacBook Pro.

Probably.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Retro gaming devices are on freakin’ fire. </strong>One of 2022’s most popular mobile gaming devices was the Miyoo Mini. Yes, a $60 chunk of plastic that’s smaller than the original iPhone and can play most everything up to O.G. Playstation games. No it’s not a Mac, but it is one of the many indicators of the rush of people seeking connections with their past, nerdier selves. There are a lot of older Mac games that people still love, but cannot play any more. Video gaming is one category that Windows nailed down quite early, but the old Macintosh gaming community is quite, very alive and well.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Mac OS 9.2.2 was released in December of 2001.</strong> It’s been twenty two years. The healthiest option would be to let go. I mean, practically, there’s zero value you can derive from Classic Mac OS that I’m aware of, but I’m sure you’ve seen my name, so who knows. Rationality, however, suggests that Apple has zero stake in holding onto the source code for Mac OS 9.2.2 and earlier. On the other hand, there is a large number of peeps who have planted their fan flags in Apple’s past who would benefit greatly from having access to the source code.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Lord knows I’m not a programmer by any stretch, </strong>but I don’t think there are many modernizations that would need to be affected to Mac OS that would allow systems from the 80’s, 90’s, and early 00’s to work more harmoniously with our internet-connected world. Take the G4 Mac mini I have on my desk. The audio doesn’t work when running Mac OS 9.2.2 from RossDarker’s modified restore image built expressly for the G4 Mini. With the source, I don’t think it would take more than a day or two to compile a new Finder with the correct hardware support.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You could help inspire a new generation of creators and makers</strong> to learn from Classic Mac OS to see where we came from and connect that to how far we’ve come. Early success on Classic Mac OS would be a huge boost to hopeful coders of any age, but without all the stress and chaos that comes from interfacing with the modern internet, and all the baggage that comes along for the ride. Mac OS 9.2.2 is still a very usable system for limited internet access and any tasks one might have completed on a machine from that era. Writing is a good one… Yes, I’m biased…</li>\n<li>\n<strong>It would be nice. </strong>There are a lot of ugly things in the world and 2023 isn’t a great time to be living, but we humans, we manage. And one of the ways we manage is to dig into hobbies and past interests. It makes us feel good, keeps our hands busy and our thoughts away from the woes of Planet Earth, at least for a little while. Not a lot of people do nice things for others. Consider this a low-cost gift to all those who have dedicated literal decades to your company. That’d be really, really nice. :)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What exactly are these people doing with these old Macs? Well, one answer to that is Sean’s channel on YouTube, Action Retro (linked below) followed by an example from YouTube.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ActionRetro\"><strong>Action Retro</strong><br><em>Extreme amateur vintage broken computering.</em>www.youtube.com</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ActionRetro\"></a>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"452\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qrS1JU1C-YE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Unboxing a SEALED 17 inch MacBook Pro 13 years later!\"></iframe></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>This is Luke Miani.

Probably call it something else, though.</p>\n<p>It’s been crystal clear for years that you prefer to maintain Steve’s course to keep tight control over the Apple experience, to preserve the intent so that the vision would live. You’ve done that, but MacOS 9 isn’t a part of the mural of Apple today.</p>\n<p>It’s now time to let others see if we can make something more from it.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Tyler K.

Blood and treasure is expended, our personal data and real money is hoovered up to feed bottomless C-suite salaries…</p>\n<p>While the World Wide Web may be comprised of an endless cavalcade of corporate entities vying for ultimate control, there remains a much, much larger contingent that has yet to stand up and take it’s own power: we average peeps.</p>\n<p>Yup. The rest of us. The rank and file, as it were. The <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> 1% of Americans who just want to get on with life minus all the drama and violence.</p>\n<p>So, within this unpleasant and difficult context, I’d like to offer my thoughts on fixing our ailing Internet. Now, I’m not going to suggest my ideas can fix all our woes, but a better foundation for our public internet can go a long way towards healing the rifts dividing and disrupting all our lives. So, let’s kick this proverbial pig.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<blockquote>\n<strong><em>NOTE</em></strong><em>: I have no idea where I learned that pig-kicking axiom. Likely the years of my youth spent in East Tennessee. Lovely place, the Smokies :)</em>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>We need a perspective change.</h3>\n<p>In this first piece, I’d like to focus on a single factor of the overarching issues plaguing the internet in 2023; user retention. In other words, keeping eyeballs on “content.” Merely look to the overwhelming success of TikTok and Instagram to see that content length has gotten dramatically shorter and screen-on times have gone up.</p>\n<p>At one point, reports in the mid ’20s indicated that, on average, Facebook earned ~$20 a year in ad-view revenue for each user. It turns out that was just for the US and Canada. When you look at the Worldwide averages, you can see that a few bucks a person can float an entire Capitalist Wonderland of exploitation. That’s the power of the individual dollar. Even Facebook knows how powerful the dollar is.</p>\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*WQ30XKcNioklNUazyeZIYQ.png\"><br>\n</div>\n<blockquote><div>\n<i>All amounts are in U.S. Dollars. </i><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/251328/facebooks-average-revenue-per-user-by-region/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>All further information on this statistic can be found at Statista</i></a><i>. So what if I use Dark Mode. It’s better on the eyes. Fight me.</i>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>This is the kind of awareness I want to see leveraged by everyone, and I will explain how… minus the exploitation, of course :) First, however, lets go over some basic principles with a few goals I have for a new Web:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It must be affordable.</strong></li>\n<li>It must be secure.</li>\n<li>It must be discoverable.</li>\n<li>It must be open source.</li>\n<li>It must benefit humanity with as few restrictions to access as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Affordability is critical, and the lowest common denominator is the US $1. In order to facilitate masses of Internet users spending $1 to subscribe to a service or creative we’ll need to do an end-run around big chunks of the corporate-controlled web with a simple, uncomplicated $1 micro-economy that naturally removes the need for advertising as a source of funding.</p>\n<p>Right now, web services are built around the classic database concept of One-To-Many.* Millions of viewers go to a single website to watch videos on YouTube. That’s how database servers work. It’s a simple idea.</p>\n<blockquote>* While this is not technically true, it’s more than accurate enough for our purposes. Most sizable web services (i.e., Google, Amazon, etc.) are distributed across servers using technologies like load balancing to redirect incoming users to physical servers that have less traffic.</blockquote>\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*0AX7D1s6G5aSGl-N\"><br>\n</div>\n<blockquote><div>\n<i>Most web servers today aren’t one machine in a rack. These four full racks could very easily be one website. </i><strong><i>Photo by </i></strong><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@tvick?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><i>Taylor Vick</i></strong></a><strong><i> on </i></strong><a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><i>Unsplash</i></strong></a>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>According to current YouTube corporate dogma, the costs to operate dictate that they sell ad space and charge Premium users $21+ a month, filtering fractions of your premium to the creators you actually do watch, after it has taken it’s cut of the advertising and membership revenue, of course. Google, Meta, Amazon and others have an effective thumb on the scales, but that advantage <strong><em>can</em></strong> be eliminated, or at least blunted.</p>\n<p>And if that wasn’t enough, we know all too well that most online services collect and sell our personal data to anyone with coin. They extract value from people who cannot or will not pay. Many creators are forced to augment their YouTube profit sharing revenue by selling in-line sponsorships which all users have to consume, even the Premium tier. And if we skip the ads, the creators get a lot less, at least that’s what I understand. This <strong><em>can</em></strong> be fixed.</p>\n<h3>A universally accessible micro-economy</h3>\n<p>Marques Brownlee is an insanely popular YouTube creator. You might also know him by his channel, MKBHD, which has, as of late September 2023, 17.6 million subscribers. One of his more recent videos about the new iPhone 15 has almost as many views as he has subscribers, an astounding 13 million.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"452\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/enR58PYHaWw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"iPhone 15/15 Pro Impressions: Not Just USB-C!\"></iframe></p>\n<blockquote><div><div><i>Wow! That’s a lot of views!!</i></div></div></blockquote>\n<p>Now, I know nothing about how much money MKBHD makes from YouTube revenue sharing, but with YouTube taking around 30% of everything, it would suggest that there’s a lot Marques is missing out on. And yes, that is sarcasm.</p>\n<p>For the fix, let’s look in the parts bin for the required technologies. I’ll explain more about this a bit later. For now, here’s what Marques would need to get started:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A media-specific Content Delivery Network (CDN) account with space enough for video uploads. <a href=\"https://www.keycdn.com/faq\" target=\"_blank\">KeyCDN appears to be the quickest to get into</a>, but you should research options.</li>\n<li>A web server, likely through a hosting service. Check out <a href=\"https://linode.com\" target=\"_blank\">Linode</a> for reasonable rates on capable Linux-based services.</li>\n<li>A Ko-Fi.com account configured with a $1 a month subscription and nothing else.</li>\n<li>A good website designer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here’s one critical point: We have everything we need to make this happen now. Allow me to repeat that more emphatically:</p>\n<blockquote>WE HAVE EVERYTHING WE NEED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN NOW! TODAY!</blockquote>\n<p>This isn’t theory. It’s not a complex new framework that depends on massive, inter-agency cooperation. We don’t need to develop any new technologies. The only thing that must be developed is familiarity with the concept itself.</p>\n<h3>So, what does this look like?</h3>\n<p>I would hope that it would look like a calm, orderly experience, but that will likely come after a few years of maturation. Let’s say, however, that Marques sets this up and tries it out.</p>\n<p>First, I imagine he’d post a video to YouTube announcing that he is opening a new streaming service outside of YouTube and invite his subscribers to join for $1 a month. Not as a promotional rate, but as the actual rate. Next, he’d upload ad-free/sponsor-free versions of his latest YouTube videos to the CDN and post them to his new single-channel streamer.</p>\n<p>If 10% of his subscribers take him up on his offer, he’d be pulling in $1.7 million a month before expenses. And yes, this means that the service would not be free, but it’s only a dollar a month and subscribers don’t have to suffer any advertising terrorism or other corporate interference.</p>\n<p>It represents a kind of freedom. A very narrowly defined freedom, but in this America now, that would be very welcoming to me.</p>\n<h3>Where can this go?</h3>\n<p>That is a valid question to which I do not have an answer. For YouTube, I think all creators with more than five million subscribers could easily do this independently, but an affordable infrastructure offering would need to be available for smaller creators. If a sufficiently large number of influential creators make such a move, CDNs other than KeyCDN will adapt to accommodate, I’m sure.</p>\n<p>Local newsrooms, radio stations, independent coffee shops, music shops and record stores, small farms and farmer’s markets, kids sports teams and teacher supplies, and other resources threatened by corporate consolidation could be buoyed by some additional support that doesn’t hurt the individual citizens wallet. Could you spare $5 a month to help your community float five small businesses against the rising tide of corporate mergers and retail assassinations?</p>\n<blockquote>It’s true. The smaller the community, the fewer the people to give $1 a month. I don’t have a fix for that, yet, but I’m brewing some lateral ideas. If you already have, leave a comment for posterity :) It’s worthless to make things better for most people and not all, and small-town America is just as important to this country as any big city. There’s also no reason why a town couldn’t take $1 donations.</blockquote>\n<p>I believe that this can be a powerful tool to return some power back to the people. It won’t fix everything, but we need to keep working towards real, viable, accessible solutions. There’s nothing wrong with fixing one thing at a time, but there are some additional notes I should make before offering my summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ko-Fi is a decent solution for now, but I suspect it would be far smarter to develop an open source solution for moving dollars around.</li>\n<li>One of the strengths of YouTube will be lost; discoverability. I have a fix for that coming in another piece, but it’s not yet ready. My smooth brain takes longer, so be patient. Any solution, however, will necessarily involve a real fix for the search engine problem.</li>\n<li>I believe that for this to work everything must be open source. There can be zero direct corporate influence on the operations of those who manage to escape their greedy clutches. It is imperative that only open source resources are leveraged. This would be a project of, by, and for the people.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>That summary I promised…</h3>\n<p>I would think that it has become crystal clear that things need to be done to save the Internet, our supposed shared resource, for those who use it from those who see it solely as another space to be plundered savagely.</p>\n<p>That’s gonna take a lot of work, but we can start small.</p>\n<p>For my next piece, I’m going to tackle the next bullet point; security. The issue has vexed me for years, but I’m quite sure I have a new way to approach the problem that has utterly fascinated me.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading :)</p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

Why can not a man lift himself by pulling up on his boot-straps?”). But it also is used to suggest “better oneself by rigorous, unaided effort.” The meaning “fixed sequence of instructions to load the operating system of a computer” (1953) is from the notion of the first-loaded program pulling itself (and the rest) up by the bootstrap. It was used earlier of electrical circuits (1946).\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, I’m fully aware of the context. The turn of phrase is meant to be a compact epithet that can be tossed at will towards those the tosser casts at persons asking for assistance with getting life off the ground. The Tosser will claim, with wide sweeping motions of their arms, that America is the <em>Land of the Free </em>and <em>Home of the Brave </em>and that all are equal.</p>\n<p><strong><em>NAY</em></strong>, they crow, if you are not a success then you have not engaged in sufficient effort and/or sacrifice. The opportunities are all around us! All you need do is stretch out your hand (and give all of yourself to Capitalism) and take it for yourself. Grab, grab, grab that bootstrap and PULL, and you too can join the ranks of the American Elite!</p>\n<p>Or something to that effect…</p>\n<p>Of course, we’re not stupid, the 99%. We know that’s an open lie. The only equality in America is for the 1% and those whose performative sycophancy allows them to remain in the Amerigarchy’s good graces… at least until they are no longer useful. How many “bodies” has Donny J. left in his wake? There are so many names you could use them for several rounds of Indictment Bingo.</p>\n<p>The reality is that there are roadblocks up everywhere, and those who work to make these hurdles have been doing so for literal decades. Unless you are white and own property, good freakin’ luck, with varying degrees of potential success depending on where your “race” falls on the “Acceptable Immigrants” list. Black and Brown? Just no.</p>\n<p>And you don’t even have to be an immigrant! You can be native-born American BIPOC and <em>still</em> get the same level of “respect” we offer our foreign guests merely seeking to “…breath free”.</p>\n<p>So, yeah. Pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps and all of the similar ideologies is utter bullshit. It’s gaslighting on a National scale.</p>\n<h3>How to fix endemic, structural racism</h3>\n<p>Stop it. Just stop. Stop discriminating. And stop lying about it, as well. It’s one of those open secrets. We all know that’s how it works, so just stop. You’ve been fuckin’ around and found out, as it were.</p>\n<p>You might infer that I’m being glib. I can assure you I am not. There is no way on any version of Earth that a short piece proclaiming the existence of something we all know exists is going to fix our woes. In the end, however, we still need to stop the discrimination.</p>\n<p>The best way to do that is to recognize every human as a human. It’s not that hard. All you have to do is not kill them or make society work any differently for people who may not look exactly like you.</p>\n<p>They’re still people, whether you like it or not.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div><hr></div>\n<div><div>\n<p>For comments, please post one single, simple thing we could all do collectively that would work towards ending discrimination. Think of it from the perspective of a long-term project… because it is.</p>\n<p>A very, very long project.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

You’re walking along, getting stuff done, and an elevator comes into the equation. Now what?</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*NGkXatx1MW2ug4AUZO6eqA.png\" title=\"Image: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*NGkXatx1MW2ug4AUZO6eqA.png\"><br>\n</div>\n<blockquote><div>\n<i>One kind of elevator call button.

In through the nose, out through the mouth so you focus on doing that instead of thinking. Slow and measured. If your heart is beating fast, breathe deeper than usual, and feel your heart calm. Practice after you exert yourself so you can do it whenever you feel the need.</li>\n<li>If the Call Button is not active, touch it. Do <strong><em>not</em></strong> stand in front of the doors. Triage any other people waiting for an elevator, putting those with fewer mobility options to the front. Don’t be afraid to speak in order to facilitate passenger selection with strangers. It’s highly unlikely that anyone will assault you for this, but remain prepared, just in case.</li>\n<li>When a car arrives at your floor you will hear a bell or electronic chime and a light will appear next to the arriving car. On the ground floor, all cars go up. On the top floor, all cars go down. Any floors between will have both UP and DOWN arrows. One will be lit to indicate which direction the car is heading when a car is at a floor. So, if you want to leave the 11th floor and go to the ground floor of building with fifteen floors, you’d wait for a car to arrive with the DOWN indicator lit. †</li>\n<li>When the doors open, quickly scan the car for any disembarking passengers. If people are exiting, stand aside and allow them safe passage. Your turn will come. If the car is empty and no one else is waiting, feel free to enter.</li>\n<li>After entering the car locate the button panel and select your floor. The panel can be on either side of the doors, or even both. If you are closest to the panel it is customary to ask any other riders which floor they require and then pressing it for them. If nobody performs this role, floor selection is open to all. Step forward and commit.</li>\n<li>Selecting where you will stand depends on how many people are in the car and where you were in the queue to enter. For large loads move to the rear and turn to face the doors. Adjust your position to accommodate any other passengers. In the US, it is highly unusual to engage in social interactions while transiting floors. It is, however, acceptable to make subtle, all-ages jokes to lighten the mood. Do not expect effusive reactions or long conversations.</li>\n<li>Once the doors close and the car is in motion it will move to each selected floor in numerical order, opening and closing the doors to allow people to embark or exit. Try to position yourself in the car with respect to your selected floor. For example, if you are on the 14th floor and other passengers are getting off on lower floors, you can move to the back. This allows others to have more room to maneuver as they engage in the same organizational dance.</li>\n<li>When you reach your floor, disembark.</li>\n</ol>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*YD4ApROvZGU-NM4M\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@gbaya123?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\">Gaurav Baya</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a><p>This may seem like a lot, but there’s no need to worry. The basic rules of operation are easy to get the hang of as long as you practice good elevator etiquette every time you use one. In no time, you’ll get the hang of it.</p>\n<h4>Additional Notes</h4>\n<p>Now, for some tips & tricks to help smooth things out. Don’t worry if you don’t get to use them every time, but these could help make your time in an elevator more pleasurable.</p>\n<p>There are a few buttons in an elevator that perform functions that are not tasked with taking passengers to a floor. Two of the most common are the OPEN and CLOSE buttons and pushing one will cause the doors to behave as instructed. Just be aware that many elevators won’t let you press the OPEN button past a set period of time, after which a buzzer will start to sound a mild alarm as an encouragement to allow the elevator to continue performing its job.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>NOTE</strong>: The OPEN and CLOSE buttons are often depicted as glyphs. The OPEN button looks something like this: <em>[<|>]</em> and the CLOSE button something like this: <em>[>|<].</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>PROTIP: If you need to keep the door open longer and don’t want the buzzer to admonish you, look for a control labeled HOLD. If there is none, that elevator doesn’t offer the feature. It could be a button or a toggle. You will find this control most commonly in Service Elevators.††</blockquote>\n<p>Did you know that elevator doors know when something or someone will block them from closing? How, you ask? There is a row of lights and light detectors inside the doors on one side, and mirrors inside the other. When any beam of light is broken, the doors stay open! Quite neat, but you can also exploit this. Place your arm across the edge of the door and you will hold it open for other passengers to enter or leave the car.</p>\n<h4>In The Unlikely Event of a Stuck Elevator…</h4>\n<p>Should nobody in the car have a mobile phone or cannot get a signal, most, if not all, elevators have either a phone or an intercom you can use to contact assistance should your elevator car stop moving at an inconvenient time, such as between floors.</p>\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*n0gNrzBnCbXIizzJ\"><br>\n</div>\n<blockquote><div>\n<i>An elevator button panel showing the HELP button. I’d never seen one with a “Help is on the way” LED before. Neat. Some have handsets while most just have a speaker grill (likely at the top in the blurry part). Photo by </i><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rssemfam?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Russ Ward</i></a><i> on </i><a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Unsplash</i></a>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>In the immortal words of Douglas Adams, “Don’t panic.”</p>\n<p>First of all, elevators are generally not air-tight, so you won’t run out of air anytime soon. Secondly, use <em>a</em> phone so someone knows where you are. Lastly, stay calm and wait patiently. At most, you’ll have a harrowing tale to tell at dinner.</p>\n<h4>In Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Run through the basics until you get them down. After a few trips on elevators using these methods you’ll get into the swing of things. Here’s a quick break-down to memorize, but after a while this will all become second nature:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Press any inactive CALL button</li>\n<li>Let anyone already on the elevator out before boarding</li>\n<li>Let those less able to board the car before you</li>\n<li>Hold the door for others as needed</li>\n<li>Be polite</li>\n<li>Get on with your day</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And that’s it! Great work and enjoy your elevator rides from now on!!</p>\n<p>† <i>A car that has been traveling up but has no more calls on higher floors can, after closing the doors, change directions. The doors will then re-open. This works even if you’ve already entered the elevator. You’ll just have to wait for the doors to cycle before you continue.</i></p>\n<p>†† <i>Service Elevators are a special variety of elevator designed to move goods and whatnot to other floors. They are generally far more utilitarian in design so that rough furniture handling doesn’t damage trim pieces or break mirrors.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

Sure, it’s a gorgeous indigo blue, but I’m old and the screen is too small. So, I bought an OLED Switch. It was also likely a mistake when instead of returning the Lite, I put it on a shelf and forgot about it. I’d made my new OLED Switch my main, so I’d just forgotten about its little brother.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<p>A few months back, I was sorting through some stuff and found it. I pulled it out again and stuck in my <em>Mario+Rabbis Kingdom Battle</em> cartridge. I didn’t put it down again for three hours.</p>\n<p>I’ve now found myself picking up the Lite more often, despite the small screen and my old eyes.</p>\n<p>Mario+Rabbids doesn’t have a lot of tiny text, so it’s easy to play on the smaller display. The same goes for most of the popular Nintendo first-party titles like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Mario Golf Super Rush, Kirby and The Forgotten Land, Luigi’s Mansion 3, and Captain Toad Treasure Tracker, to mention just a few that I have played on both systems.</p>\n<p>Now, I’ve never played my Switch OLED for longer than an hour and a half. While I do love it, I don’t like everything about it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Joycons are slightly above average, but the ergonomics are definitely the worst among the major console and controller makers offerings. I have a simple TPU slip-on case for the Lite that adds grips. There are no usable options for Joycons that I’ve found. There are loads of 3rd party options, but I shouldn’t have to spend more money to comfortably use the thing I already paid for and they’re all full cases, ungainly in some manner, or ridiculous looking. How hard is it to make snap-on parts for Joycons?</li>\n<li>I don’t play fighting games, but I do hate the Switch D-pad. It’s not even a D-pad, but a copy/paste operation of the A/B/X/Y buttons from the right Joycon. I thought I hated the disc-type the most, but this loose collection of unconnected buttons don’t feel right and sit far too low on the Joycon. It’s annoying. On the other, very awkward hand, the D-pad on the Switch Lite is phenomenal, likely because it’s the same D-pad as the New 3DS.</li>\n<li>The dock is a waste of plastic and I’d not be surprised to find that some people still think it has another processor inside to make the Switch run faster and at higher resolutions when in TV mode. I hate to shatter your fever dream, but no. They could easily reduce it in size by at least 60% and still get the job done. It’s waste and it’s irresponsible and Nintendo can do much better.</li>\n<li>Then there’s the headline; it’s heavy. No, it’s not terribly weighty, but compared to the Lite, it’s a chonker. And all of this extra weight comes from the Switch’s primary functional gimmick, to switch from handheld to console mode. Many parts of the tablet section are made from aluminum, and the Joycon rails are also metal. In stark contrast, the Lite uses an all-plastic shell that has the added benefit of being easily colored, and joycons that are integrated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, here’s what I propose. Easy, really. Just super-size the Lite. A Lite XL, or LL if you hale from another continent, if you will. Make it $269, because that’s a nice price, and stop selling the OG Switch.</p>\n<p>Yeah. That’s pretty much it. Just do that, and we’re fantastic, Nintendo :)</p>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

Now, I know that’s a scientific principle of something, but I’m no scientist so I’m not sure how accurate I’ll be, but this whole thing seems rather obvious to me. So much so, that I’m more than a little shocked no rabid capitalistas have leapt on the Bidet Bandwagon. And no, that bandwagon doesn’t sound very fun, but we’ll get to the bidet in a moment. First, we need to talk about toilet paper.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/15676/cmo-toilet-paper-consumption/\"><strong>Infographic: The U.S. Leads the World in Toilet Paper Consumption</strong><br><em>The Statista \"Chart of the Day\" currently focuses on two sectors: \"Media and Technology\", updated daily and featuring…</em>www.statista.com</a><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/15676/cmo-toilet-paper-consumption/\"></a>\n</div>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2019/02/28/us-toilet-paper-consumption-canada-forests/?xid=soc_socialflow_twitter_FORTUNE&amp;xid=soc_socialflow_twitter_FORTUNE\"><strong>The Average American Uses 3 Rolls of Toilet Paper Each Week-And It's Devastating Forests</strong><br><em>A new report on paper use says Americans are flushing away Canadian forests.

Note that the rolls they are referencing are 90 grams (Siri says that’s 3.7 ounces), which I’m assuming are the classic-style rolls. Of course, almost everyone buys the jumbo and mega roll packs, so some basic maths will need to be performed…</p>\n<p>Oh, never mind! Some nice person over at The Federalist, a right-wing eTabloid, took care of that for us. Go ahead. Read it. It won’t bite, but you might come away with a spike in your depression for a few days.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2019/03/02/no-average-american-doesnt-use-three-rolls-toilet-paper-per-week/\"><strong>No, Each American Doesn't Use Three Rolls Of Toilet Paper Per Week</strong><br><em>Fortune magazine's toilet paper numbers are full of crap.

No, we are, as I just mentioned, buying those large rolls so… We’re not <em>really</em> using a 141 rolls a year, per American, mind you, we’re really using 56.</p>\n<p>And that’s a whole lot less than 141… Right?</p>\n<p>I guess the simple fact that slipped past this stable genius is that the heavier rolls are longer and have more material in them. You know, all those plys, they come from somewhere, dude. Go to Costco, Walmart, Sam’s Club, or any big box store that carries toilet paper, and you’ll find stacks of “Double” and “Triple” roll options.</p>\n<p>So, Kyle, let’s talk this out. I think you could be right that most Americans use about one roll a week, but you know, those rolls are double and triple that basic roll, so its still approximately <strong><em>THREE ROLLS A WEEK</em></strong>. The fact that there are double and triple roll products explains the 2.7 rolls a week that the study actually cites, the number “3” being rounded for clarity and because rounding numbers isn’t typically considered a criminal act.</p>\n<p>Science is hard. I get it.</p>\n<p>Also, I should note that the Fortune piece above was published in 2019, <em>before the pandemic</em>. I doubt that Americans used more toilet paper during lockdowns, but we sure as hell bought a lot more at one time. Gotta love those hoarders and preppers. Of course, you can only hoard essentials if you have the resources to do so.</p>\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*1Tx-1X2UzH35FWVY1-6xhQ.gif\"><br>\n</div>\n<blockquote><div><i>Oh… Kyle… Wow, man. I’m so sorry…</i></div></blockquote>\n<h3>Damn, that’s lot of toilet paper</h3>\n<p>Let’s get down to brass tacks. Nobody likes wiping. It’s gross and irritating and the paper can fall apart, and don’t get me started about criminally thin industrial-grade TP in public, retail and commercial bathrooms. It gets stuck to shoes, falls out of trash cans, doesn’t evacuate “the crevasse”, and periodically difficult to locate for purchase. Yeah, everybody poops, but I’m quite sure most of us don’t like it. It may be biological process necessary for the proper operation of the human body, but it’s a pain in the ass, literally and figuratively.</p>\n<p>Must we complicate it? Turns out we kind of need to, and yes, there is a Wikipedia entry on “Anal Hygiene.”</p>\n<blockquote>I’d like to take a moment to point out the atrocious grammar in the following Wikipedia page summary that makes it sound like hygienic practices are performed by one group of people on another group of people’s anuses…like a service?

Short Answer: It’s not.</p>\n<p>No. Nobody expects everyone to install a bidet. I’d be shocked if anyone in government ever suggested that installations be mandatory. It’s not some kind of weird poop-specific conspiracy, either.

It’s you!! Chris Wedge!!! Nice pic. Great movie.<p>Dear Chris,</p>\n<p>I heard the news. I’m sorry I didn’t write sooner. Things have been a tad crazy of late, what with the pandemic and gun violence and political division and illegal wars and whatnot. I started writing this before the war and Uvalde, but I felt it was important to acknowledge these facts of life and death we are facing before I launch into this escapist fever dream. Anyway…</p>\n<p>Disney can be quite the pain in the ass these days, what with all the acquisitions and late-stage Capitalism and all. I recently read the Paste piece, <a href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/scrat-tales-blue-sky-studios-oral-history/#the-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>An Oral History of Scrat Tales: The Death and Legacy of Blue Sky Studios</em></strong></a>, and I feel for you and your peeps. For the record, I don’t think it was a mistake to be hopeful that Disney would act to protect contemporaries of the modern animation industry. You know, because Disney is one of the most prolific animation studios ever.</p>\n<p>Such presence gives you the impression that they might commiserate. In retrospect, they <em>did</em> end up protecting a legacy, namely their own … by engaging in predatory catch-and-kill just to shut you down and absorb your valuable intellectual property and talent. But hey! Live and learn, right? We just have to process and integrate the setbacks and and keep pushing forward while keeping a sharp eye on our past, as it informs us of potential futures and how to avoid them. (If that’s what “we” want, that is.)</p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div><iframe width=\"666\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8dIhNRPbfBE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen title=\"Bunny\"></iframe></div>\n<p>And there’s nothing Disney can do to erase Blue Sky’s legacy as one of the few smaller studios that could offer the big players a challenge at the box office, to be sure alongside Chris Meledandri’s Illumination. Thirty-five years, thirteen theatrical films, more than $5 billion in revenues, and two Oscar nominations, Blue Sky was no joke. Dude! You yourself won a freaking Oscar for <strong><em>Bunny </em></strong>back in 1998 only to release <strong><em>Ice Age</em></strong> two years later. And I don’t care what anyone says, but 2005’s <strong><em>Robots</em></strong> is a just a masterpiece. One of the truly underrated greats, in the same vein as <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138749/?ref_=ttls_li_tt\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Road to El Dorado</em></strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129167/?ref_=ttls_li_tt\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Iron Giant</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong>(Vin Diesel’s best role by far), or Disney’s own <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120917/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Emperor’s New Groove</em></strong></a>, to name a few.</p>\n<p>You, sir, are a force in the world of animation.</p>\n<p>But, here we are. It’s 2022 and it has become clear that being a force for anything offers no friction to Disney’s ambitions. If they want to take on or end something, they can simply buy it. It’s like Disney went to the park with its ball, had a great time with everyone else while doing their damnedest to ignore you, and when he took his ball to go home, took your tricycle for good measure. And it’s not like the pandemic has been ‘helpful.’ I wouldn’t be shocked in the slightest to learn that aspects of Disney’s decision to close Blue Sky was to let them shunt more cash into their cash strapped amusement park division and fretting over content for their then upcoming Disney+ streaming service.</p>\n<h4>Looks like someone needs a new tricycle…</h4>\n<p>So, this is a pitch… of sorts. But it’s not a pitch for me. I’m simply offering the concept. I have no skills aside from stringing some vaguely comprehensible words together in sequence, but I do have an imagination. No, it’s a pitch for you.</p>\n<p>Animate books.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m not talking about the atrocious adaptations (not ADAPTIONS, people! A-dap-TAY-shuns, for cryin’ out loud) that plague our cinematic past, or even the really good ones, for that matter. Regardless of the quality, or lack thereof, these adaptations necessarily strip out loads of context, interactions and impressions, additional plot lines, and almost everything else to focus on the core story because, you know… two hours.</p>\n<p>So, as insane as it sounds, what if you <em>don’t</em> do that. Instead, adapt the book as closely to the written work as possible. Take the dialog wholesale. Design the scenes to appear as described in the pages. In other words, use the book as the script, stage direction and all. Make each page fly out of the book and into a tangible world where the rules make sense because you know the story in static form.</p>\n<p>A few more suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t change anything unless you have to for technical reasons. If the book is worthy to adapt, why would you change anything that wasn’t already constrained by the animation process, and we both know that animation offers no constraints. Period. We can do <em>anything</em> in animation.</li>\n<li>Don’t modify the plot, motivation or conflict so “modern” audiences can “relate” to it better. Again, if we love the tale, what benefit comes from modifying a major part of what made it resonate?</li>\n<li>Any character description should be taken as canon, everything else is fair game. If the author doesn’t mention any particular aspect or aspects of a character, you can flesh them out how you like, but if something is clearly stated, it needs to be there. Taking a text description into a fully-realized visual world means a lot will need to be filled in. The book, after all, is for the theater of the mind, so some expanded development is almost assuredly required for most any book.</li>\n<li>Don’t feel stuck making a film. In fact, DON’T make a film. Make a series, and make it as long as it needs to be to fit everything from the book in. Some books will lend themselves well to adapting a chapter to an episode rather neatly, while others might need more creative solutions. Trust the viewers to watch as little or as much as they prefer, much like reading a book!</li>\n<li>Hire the best voice actors for the cast, not just the “best” celebrity stand-ins. Name one time someone told you that the only reason they went to see a film was because actor X, Y, or Z was in the cast and no other reason. The draw is the tale itself, not whatever A-lister is attached to it. Sure, it’s a force multiplier, but this shouldn’t be about massive, unlimited profits, but the artfulness of the work and how it reflects on our human existence or shows us parts of ourselves that might help us better understand us as living, thinking creatures drifting through space and time just hoping the ride is mostly nice along the way. I don’t doubt, however, that money will be made.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If I, as a complete nobody that brings nothing to the fore, were to opine on a first step, I’d say take it slow. I’d shoot for a few test scenes from a book of your choice. If I were to choose, I’d start with Isaac Asimov, preferably Caves of Steel, the first in his Robot series.</p>\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*VeV38uKbkn-cXTN-p49r3Q.jpeg\"><br>\n</div>\n<blockquote><div>\n<i>The description of Isaac Asimov’s “The Caves of Steel” taken from </i><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41811.The_Caves_of_Steel\" target=\"_blank\"><i>GoodReads.com</i></a><i> — “A millennium into the future two advancements have altered the course of human history: the colonization of the galaxy and the creation of the positronic brain. Isaac Asimov’s Robot novels chronicle the unlikely partnership between a New York City detective and a humanoid robot who must learn to work together. Like most people left behind on an over-populated Earth, New York City police detective Elijah Baley had little love for either the arrogant Spacers or their robotic companions. But when a prominent Spacer is murdered under mysterious circumstances, Baley is ordered to the Outer Worlds to help track down the killer. The relationship between [Lije] and his Spacer superiors, who distrusted all Earthmen, was strained from the start. Then he learned that they had assigned him a partner: R. Daneel Olivaw. Worst of all was that the “R” stood for robot — and his positronic partner was made in the image and likeness of the murder victim!” The novel is one of Asimov’s many “proofs” that science fiction can be applied to any genre, not just its own, not that Asimov needed to prove anything to anyone :)</i>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>Simply put, and apologies for being a tad brutal here, but nobody has given the idea of a 1:1 adaptation through the artistry and flexibility of animation a go before, and it’s not like you’ve got much else going on… I mean you’re exec’ing on some Puyo Puyo movie and some “Popeye” thing. That can hardly be taxing.</p>\n<p>I kid… a little.</p>\n<p>With the right property, the correct treatment, with solid massaging by a quality team that groks the rules, I think you’d have one killer app on your hands, and significant demand for more. But like I said before getting excited again, take it even slower.</p>\n<p>Whip the first few chapters of Caves of Steel into storyboard form. Try blocking out some solutions for inner monologues and other “unfilmables”. Cobble out a few scenes, see how they work around the dialog. How much runtime can you get out of a chapter?</p>\n<p>Of course, for a storied legend in your field, this would be a cake walk.</p>\n<p>;P</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Tyler Knows Nothing</p>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<div><div>\n<p>How do we define the United States of America? We call it a country, but that just means a plot of land with established borders. Land certainly tells stories, but those tales are woven over millennia, and definitions within that context just don’t scale down for the convenience of our human time-frame.</p>\n<p>The first quote I think of in regards to the makeup of our government is that it is formed…</p>\n<blockquote><strong>…of the people, by the people, and for the people…</strong></blockquote>\n<p>Sounds familiar, right? Well, it’s <em>not</em> from the US Constitution. <a href=\"https://www.bookbrowse.com/expressions/detail/index.cfm/expression_number/600/government-of-the-people-by-the-people-for-the-people\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https://www.bookbrowse.com/expressions/detail/index.cfm/expression_number/600/government-of-the-people-by-the-people-for-the-people\">The quote comes from Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, and the idea had been discussed by others for centuries</a>. That might disappoint you, if you didn’t know that until now, but we do have an actual Constitution. If you need a refresher, here’s the subject of today’s Shallow Thoughts, the Preamble:</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*USMygU6QKPBEoTDYjS8O8w.png\" title=\"Image: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*USMygU6QKPBEoTDYjS8O8w.png\">See if you can find the correction in the Preamble. Surprisingly, there are lots of corrections in the Constitution, which raises a question. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2016/01/most-consequential-comma/625192/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2016/01/most-consequential-comma/625192/\">If this was accepted as the final draft for the establishment of an entire country, how many punctuation errors are there, say, in the 2nd Amendment</a>?<blockquote>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.</blockquote>\n<p>You see, Lincoln’s sentiment is squishy and unclear. It’s nice, but it is not a ratified legal document. Just because the president says it, doesn’t make it law, or even true. It’s an aspirational concept. The Preamble, on the other hand, is a lucid, if flowery, 10,000 ft. outline of the idea behind America. At the time the definition of “people” was limited to white folk, but that’s the thing about weasel language being used to establish important institutions. The words you choose could have an unintended outcome at some point in the future.</p>\n<p>That point in time has been here since, at the very least, Reconstruction and “We the people” must now mean all humans. So-called “minorities” have been struggling for inclusion in the privileged caste since their feet first touched the shores of this ancient land, and while we’ve made progress over the course of a few hundred years, we keep getting dragged back by parties who are both inclined towards racial animosity and have amassed the resources necessary to control the direction of government. Those “resources” also include questionably warm bodies like almost the entire Republican party currently in office. Besides, much of the progress seen in minority populations is merely token, a bone if you will, to keep the boat from rocking too much.</p>\n<h4>Wading the shallows…</h4>\n<p>It might just be me, lord knows I never finished college (half a dozen times), but when your founding document starts with “We the people” and you use the formalized structure of organized society outlined in said document to exclude actual human people from deriving those benefits or achieving those aspirations while simultaneously granting favored whites free reign to commit crimes against minority bodies, that it specifically means we haven’t achieved the very first, most basic mandate of our Constitution in nearly 250 years?</p>\n<p>Kinda feels like we’ve all been getting gaslit for the last 400 years.</p>\n<p>Or maybe, just maybe*, we had a Civil War over the enslavement of human beings for purposes of building the nation we stole from the natives who had been establishing societies for thousands upon thousands of years where the slavers lost, but <strong><em>because of government flaccidity on the matter, didn’t bother actually enforcing equality for all those supposedly now free, new Americans and caved on States Rights, so that racist states could continue to oppress its citizens, but now with a veneer of sovereign legitimacy</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>Who knew we’d develop such deep, violent rifts between races in a country where non-white humans have been chewed up and spat out, all to appease fragile white egos, but what do I know…</p>\n</div></div>\n<div><hr></div>\n<div><div>\n<p><i>PS: YouTube is something of a cesspool. Despite this, I really love it. Well, I love the creators. Most of my content consumption is on YouTube, as I’ve found many, many creators who love what they do and put in the work. And yet, much of YouTube is filled with crap. Sure, it might be a nice place to keep your family videos of your meals and pets or terribly racist screeds and calls for race wars, but all the extra bandwidth, in storage, over the network, and in your hardware/software solutions, consume a constant flow of electricity to maintain.</i></p>\n<p><i>PPS: Meanwhile, our Earth-bound resources, which have a limited lifespan, are being burnt to spin the turbines that delivers power to the infrastructure, systems, suppliers, and services that reliably energize global capitalism efforts, but is used as a tool of oppression for the terminally lower class minorities. Don’t pay your bill, you get cut off, so you have to work, but you can only take a job that pays minimum wage, which isn’t a living wage, so you need to take another job or two, just to keep the water and lights on and for trash to get picked up on occasion. Oh, and don’t forget rent…</i></p>\n<p><i>PPPS: As the non-1% are dragged along with hypercapitalism’s reckless, futile desire to chase the mythological beast of unlimited growth, it seems we must make ourselves content with just waiting to see what happens. Maybe we should rewrite the Preamble:</i></p>\n<blockquote><i>We the selfish, recognized white People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union in our image, establish Justice for some, insure domestic Tranquility for the few, provide for the common defence of the powerful, promote the general Welfare of private business, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to just us and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America until we think it’s no longer worth maintaining and drop the pretense.</i></blockquote>\n<p><i>And if that’s what’s going to happen, then the death of planet Earth will come sooner, at least for us, than I think most of us would hope. The wealthy and their sycophants will just build themselves bunkers or whatnot so they’ll live, as will their descendants, and what do you think their parents are going to teach them about the world?</i></p>\n<p><i>What, indeed.</i></p>\n</div></div>\n<div><hr></div>\n<div><div><blockquote>* There’s no question that the Civil War happened due to disagreements over slavery. I’m just being sarcastic. The enslavement of human beings should never, ever be something that can be disagreed with. It’s criminal. Period.</blockquote></div></div>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

It’s not an enormous issue, but it bothers me. As you have likely already gleaned, I am receiving junk mail in my Outlook.com account which is already flagged, like so:</p>\n<div>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*mTRNPTkqJPeb0v7z-to2EA.png\" title=\"Image: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*mTRNPTkqJPeb0v7z-to2EA.png\"><br>\n</div>\n<blockquote><div><i>An example of a pre-flagged spam message.</i></div></blockquote>\n<p>I don’t think most people have noticed it for a couple reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don’t think a lot of users flag their emails unless they are using the desktop version.</li>\n<li>Flagging is a visual cue that has only recently started to become a component of organization tools, i.e., Microsoft To Do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Outlook.com, however, is an interesting beast; at once the best damned email client on the planet while being rather terrible at handling spam… sorta. I’ll get to the best part in a sec, but Google’s Gmail is far better at filtering spam.</p>\n<p>The online version of Outlook was originally designed to not only replace HoTMaiL (if you’ve never noticed, the capitalization is deliberate), but to compete with the growing number of players in the nascent Webmail arena. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#1995%E2%80%932007:_Foray_into_the_Web,_Windows_95,_Windows_XP,_and_Xbox\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft had fumbled in the early days of the internet</a> had to catch up to the growth of services like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail\" target=\"_blank\">Google’s Gmail</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RocketMail\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo!’s RocketMail</a>, and offerings from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_Mail\" target=\"_blank\">AOL</a> (“You’ve Got Mail!”) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompuServe\" target=\"_blank\">Compuserve</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2012, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlook.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlook.com\">Microsoft replaced Microsoft Live Hotmail with Outlook.com</a>, and offered the Beta version to the general public to try. I joined that beta, and added an Outlook.com address to my seldom-used Hotmail account. I was immediately impressed with the new interface, and have mostly enjoyed using it over Gmail for years now. The current version of Outlook.com is extremely complete, and I can understand why casual users might find it confusing. If, however, you are experienced with using the Outlook desktop application, you won’t have too steep a learning curve.</p>\n<p>But it’s generally never about the features that work when I post. In this case, it’s about spam getting flagged automatically. This is a real problem now, and I’ll explain why, but let’s first take a look at what another Windows user posted to Microsoft’s community support forums:</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*I2lLbbKFv0wyBHL2AS_xsA.png\">This is one of the only posts I could find about this issue and the answers were… unhelpful?<p>As you likely noted in the image at the top of this post, I’ve been having the same problem. Some emails will come set to Urgent and Flagged. Flagging a message in any version of Outlook is a visual indicator that you, as the user, add to show importance or act as a reminder. As I mentioned before, the Flag has traditionally been a user-only function.</p>\n<p>That changed after Microsoft acquired Wunderlist from German developer 6Wunderkinder GmbH.</p>\n<p>That’s not to suggest that Redmond’s acquisition had a lot to do with the issues I and other(s?) face, but it’s how I discovered the issue in the first place. I used Wunderlist as an all around replacement for Evernote and a checklist app. It was very good at that, but MS decided they needed an app like that, so they bought the company and finally phased out Wunderlist on May 6th of this year. Now we have To Do, a fine app that leans even more into the task management space.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, one of its neat little productivity features is that it has an auto-generated listicle with all of your Flagged messages. This would really be great if it worked as intended, showing the items you flagged so you can be reminded to handle them. Instead, upon initial inspection I was treated to a cavalcade of Coronavirus cures, manhood pills, offers of millions of dollars from some dead prince in Idaho or Saskatchewan or Kazakhstan.</p>\n<p>So, that’s about it. There’s no real solution that I’ve sussed out just yet, nor have I seen very many questions posted about it. Like I said, I don’t think a lot of people are going to experience what I believe is an edge case. This just doesn’t yet happen to many users.</p>\n<p>We’ll see where things go from here.</p>\n<p><em>PS: This is a repost from my blog, which I’ve been having issues with. I’m now in the process of making a decision about where my bloggings will reside. My options are to restore WordPress on my most atrocious host, go back to PostHaven (which I adore but has posting and formatting limitations), or devote my efforts to Medium (which has an in-built audience.) I have yet to choose.</em></p>\n<p><em>PPS: Part of the problem, and it’s a large part, is the depression I’ve been “managing” over the years.

It drew the leaf peepers and they brought their money. We didn’t turn in those circles, or any circles for that matter. We spent time at home or at school or with the baby or at various jobs. She worked at the Vermont State Department of Corrections for a time. I worked at the nearby IBM plant for a spell. I attempted another go at college. I’d like to think we failed each other.</p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>Have a listen to the album while reading this piece.<p>The radio station that had to be on in the car at the time was The Point FM, <em>de rigueur</em> for any self-respecting AAA aficionado. Where else was one to catch up with the latest singles from Big Head Todd &amp; The Monsters, R.E.M. or Dave Matthews Band, note the dates for a coming Phish show, or score a tip on hemp floor mats or locally roasted coffee (yes, <em>that</em> Green Mountain Coffee.)</p>\n<p>I honestly don’t recall the track from this album I heard on the radio that caused me to suddenly know I had to own it, but it could have been any of them. Normally, I have at the very least, a sense of which track, but not this one. All I know is I got in the car, drove down to the Sam Goody (I think, might have been a Wherehouse) off the 189 at Shelburne, and bought the cassette. I slapped it into the tape deck and listened to it all the way home.</p>\n<p>Thank you, Auto Reverse.</p>\n<p>Little did I know at the time, but Francis Dunnery was to become a very important figure in my one-person chapter of Tyler’s Music Appreciation Society. In 1998, however, I didn’t place as much importance on music as I would later in life, specifically in regard to my progressive self-education. Hell, at the time I hadn’t yet come to grips with The Blues and still had a stunted understanding of Jazz.</p>\n<p>I knew at the time, however, that Dunnery spoke to me with his lyrical content, compositional style, sound, and his distinctive vocal quality. I’ve come to understand this as Storyteller Syndrome; my principle thesis on progressive rock. In a nutshell, that one thing that sets progressive apart from its core genre is story telling. Most people think that “Prog Rock” is epic long tracks with soaring guitars, complex beats, and tales of space ships and wizards. I propose that couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>\n<blockquote><em>Rocks songs are about love and loss. Prog rock songs are about stories. — Tyler Regas, 2020</em></blockquote>\n<p>Even the most epic prog rock band of all time forever and ever, known to mortals as Rush, moved away from 15 minute long tracks and tales about hobbits and dragons to more socially conscious fare packaged into tighter, radio-friendly formats. In 1973, Yes released Tales from Topographic Oceans, four songs stretched over two albums, and completely radio-hostile. Just a decade later, and Yes would have a huge radio hit with Owner of a Lonely Heart. I don’t think anyone would argue that Yes should be disavowed. That would be absurd.</p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p>Now, I won’t try to suggest that any song that tells a story is progressive. No. It’s more than that. It has to be something new but retain principle elements of rock music, to take that music in a new direction, and evoke a reaction in the listener, one that provokes new avenues of thought or introspection, through storytelling or other narrative structures. This can even be done instrumentally. Just take a listen to any of Simon Phillips’ Protocol albums, Plini, or Arch Echo.</p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>Tell me that Biplane to Bermuda doesn’t paint an interesting picture…<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>Lush, hard prog rock instrumental soundscapes.<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>If you love Animals As Leaders but miss recognizable song structure.<p>In a way, we get to witness Dunnery’s trajectory through the late stages of the Golden Age of Progressive through his stint as frontman for influential UK band It Bites and into his solo albums. Not well known outside of the UK, It Bites is what I personally recognize as the last of the original progressive rocks bands of the golden era of prog. <a href=\"https://francisdunnery.bandcamp.com/album/vampires-regular-download\" target=\"_blank\">Most notable of his solo efforts is 2016’s <strong>Vampires</strong> release on Band Camp</a> where he makes what he had originally intended for certain It Bites tracks quite clear, if you know what I mean. They have since come to terms.</p>\n<p>The late 90’s, however, were different for me. Not having the benefit of hindsight, we carried on with whatever priorities we had at the time, and that was taking care of Leah and making sure we could pay the bills. The writing work had started to take off and the local clients we consulted for were stable. We only had the issues facing us at the time and had no idea that, in just a few years the Twin Towers would fall and seven years after that America would experience the biggest financial collapse since The Great Depression.</p>\n<p>It seems that time really doesn’t have an impact. We’re still facing disaster, only it’s different and worse and our fault since we let that buffoon Trump get elected in the first place, but that’s beside the point. These days there’s plenty to be concerned about and for. We don’t know what’s going to be coming around the next corner, and it seems like we come to a new one several times a day. Even as we turn into 2021, we’re still exhausted by the chaos of it all, everything a question mark.</p>\n<p>Back then, however, I just enjoyed listening to the music. Not that I knew at the time, but I had that luxury. We all did. I think we all can again, at least for a few moments.</p>\n<p>Just start up the album. It’s at the top of the page in case you forgot. Sit back in a comfortable chair and just listen.</p>\n<blockquote><em>Think about the chord progression.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote><em>Think about the beat.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote><em>The rhythm.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote><em>Tonality.</em></blockquote>\n<p>Think about the lyrics, the story being told. Don’t worry about understanding it all just yet. Instead, let yourself sink into the music and just enjoy it, and nothing else, for a track or two.

Well, not spiral, really, but there is no term that describes a rectangular shaped stairwell in a multi-story building. It didn’t matter, though. There was already a name for it. It was called The Nothing, and it had been named a few generations back, long before I was born. I come to stare into The Nothing quite often. There isn’t much else to do and it wasn’t forbidden. In fact, the Elders encouraged it, likely to instill a sense of dread. People fear the dark. It’s not that it’s darkness, but that you don’t know what could be hiding inside of it. After all, there isn’t anything threatening about an absence of light.\n</div>\n<p>Back in “The Day”, people would venture down into The Nothing to see how far they could get. At some point they decided that it would be smart to remove the doors so that the light could shine into The Nothing, at least until it couldn’t. Few people had been down to the Last Door, but I went at least once or twice a month. There was a thrill that ran through me like a shiver as I would look down at the Last Door and the impenetrable darkness just beyond. Our Elders tell tales of the Doormen who had taken the Last Door off of it’s hinges.</p>\n<blockquote>The final pin falls, the Doormen laugh.<br>Ping, ping, ping, then into The Nothing.<br>Then it makes no sound. Did it stop?<br>The Doormen reset their steely resolve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>One step, two. The Nothing remains silent.<br>Two step, three. Doorman Pellis vanishes.<br>Doorman Stev reaches out to grab nothing.<br>The beginning of The Nothing is found.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Do not venture past the Last Door.<br>The 28th is the End of Our World.</blockquote>\n<p>The Elders made it sound ominous and scary, but nobody knew what was beyond The Nothing. There was nothing to indicate what was different. Every once in a while, some idiot would head down there, drunk on Roofberry Wine, and his friends would dare them. A few times it was proven that touching the 3rd step down from the 28th floor caused people to literally vanish. They didn’t fall. They’d just blink out. I wasn’t eager to discover the truth of it, so I stayed on the 29th, looking down. That was satisfaction enough for me.</p>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

Be Elon Musk.</p>\n<p>Step 2. Buy Twitter for $45 billion.</p>\n<p>Step 3. Tweet.</p>\n<p>Step 4. Never, ever apologize for anything.</p>\n<p>Now just sit back, soak in the sun on some private island, sip on your cocktail, check your stocks and bank balances, and wait. Of course, your tweets may or may not have an impact on how long the process takes, so you may not wish to stop or have some unpaid interns handle it for you. Regardless, your mileage may vary. Now, there’s a very strong chance that you are unable to overcome the requirements for Step 1, but I have faith in you!</p>\n<p>Once in the “Zone” though, Step 2 is likely even more difficult, but stay strong. You’ll just have to get together about $50 billion and buy Twitter. The rub there is that some other guy also named Elon Musk has recently bought another company called Twitter <em>also</em> for $45 billion, but an extra $5B should square things up in no time! Remember, don’t slouch and smile…</p>\n<p>As for Step 3, tweeting has never been a problem for you. My god, if there was a good version of the phrase ‘verbal diarrhea’, that would be my catch phrase for you!</p>\n<blockquote>Elon Musk would saunter by and I’d say, “There goes Mr. [GOOD VERSION OF VERBAL DIARRHEA]” and people would know I’m talking about you.</blockquote>\n<p>Which brings me to the final step, Step 4: Never, ever apologize for anything. And why should you!? I mean you are one of the wealthiest humans on the planet (I’m not sure where you’re at on the rich people’s Bank Balance Olympics® after going into the hole for $45B, but I’m sure it’s still quite high) and you didn’t get there by doing little more than nothing, did you!</p>\n<h3><strong>NO!</strong></h3>\n<p>You, sir, are an ALPHA!! They need to be shown who’s really, truly the boss and who’s gonna be callin’ the shots from here on out. Better yet, just do whatever you want! Like with all those Twitter employees you’ve fired violating FTC rules on advanced notice requirements for companies the size of Twitter. But that’s just dumb poor people stuff that doesn’t apply to you, Mr. GVoVD! Wow!! That would make a fantastic bumpersticker for SpaceX’s Crew Dragon!!!</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*1OOYRUq44G1YC4Knax6wJg@2x.jpeg\">That’d look fantastic in space!<p>But I digress. Once you’ve fulfilled all of these requirements, you should be all set. I truly hope that we’ve met, nay, exceeded your huge, multi-national corporation dismantling and irresponsible currency disposal services today.</p>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

Apple effectively created the home computer industry, and Microsoft has been doggedly chasing after ever since. This is not a new story in the slightest.</p>\n<p>Historical documents tell us that Steve Jobs managed to arrange a tour at Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center, frequently called Xerox PARC, which had been tasked by their parent company with developing a wide range of modern computing technologies for the future. The PARC teams were responsible for laster printers, Ethernet, the desktop paradigm for graphical user interfaces, e-paper, Very Large-Scale Integration or VLSI, the process which made all of the computer chips we use today even possible, and the Alto, among other things.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*Q73gVCABMM9oQ2tUfSSRlA.jpeg\" title=\"Image: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*Q73gVCABMM9oQ2tUfSSRlA.jpeg\">A Xerox Alto II on display… somewhere. Unfortunately, the contributor didn’t note <em>where they had taken the picture, so it’s anyone’s guess, though likely a computer museum… again, somewhere.</em><p>The Alto II was an amalgam of all of the technologies developed at PARC and was effectively a “desktop” computer. The idea might seem insane when you look at the literal behemoth above, but this where we were back then. The Alto II was never released as a product for the general public and only 2,000 were built, mostly deployed inside PARC with some distributed to universities. Many believe that the Mac team’s exposure to the work on the GUI at PARC helped them break through some of their final stumbling blocks before the release of the Macintosh in 1984. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zfqw8nhUwA\" target=\"_blank\">I’m pretty sure we’ve all seen the Super Bowl commercial</a>…</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/10/steve-jobs-xerox-parc.html\"><strong>The truth about Steve Jobs and Xerox PARC</strong><br><em>or are there many \"truths\"?

During an interview, he said “SRI patented the mouse, but they really had no idea of its value. Some years later it was learned that they had licensed it to Apple Computer for something like $40,000.” Not a great deal, peeps…<h4>Avoiding the rabbit hole…</h4>\n<p>So as to avoid a long(er) narrative about the history of the mouse, let’s leave it there and move to this piece’s <em>raison d’être</em>; the mind bogglingly silly problem of computer mouse scroll wheel scrolling directions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<strong><em>You</em></strong> try to use fewer words to describe it whilst insuring all readers know what you’re talking about! I’m open to suggestions.</blockquote>\n<p>I’m quite sure most casual users who have always used a Mac or a Windows machine likely haven’t given a single thought to which direction the document in the display scrolls when you roll the scroll wheel up or down or drag two fingers across a trackpad. It’s kind of a thing that most people get. Kids learn all this stuff before they can string words together, for crying out loud!</p>\n<p>But for users like myself who use both macOS and Windows operating systems, it’s a pain. (For the record, I’m also a Linux power user. Mint, Pop, and Fedora, in that order.) Here’s why:</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*WR0LDc5Pvl3DsNQnPpL9XQ.gif\"><a href=\"https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/natural-scrolling-mac-vs-reverse-scrolling-windows-e48656275081\" target=\"_blank\">Take a look at Kunal Rathore’s excellent article on the Mac’s natural scrolling versus Windows’ established reverse scrolling implementation</a>, including a lovely animated illustration to, uh… illustrate the difference for those who have withstood the awesome attraction of “the other side”.<p>As you can plainly see, they just do the opposite. It’s not like you can iterate on a linear motion control. It goes up. It goes down. There’s not a lot of room for creativity. If you take a look at the Mouse settings in macOS and Windows you’ll start to see where the problem lies. Let’s look at macOS 12.4 “Monterey” and how it handles scrolling options:</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*_Pf5JLihpla_cuyQnmpSjA.png\" title=\"Image: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*_Pf5JLihpla_cuyQnmpSjA.png\">WHAT? The Mac makes this an OPTION???!!! I sense the Windows user inside me starting to get nervous…<p>Well, how does Windows handle this, then? Let’s take a look at my HP EliteBook running Windows 10 and it’s scroll wheel options:</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*Za0CtTfk9lOsTG2aonn-3A.jpeg\">I like Dark Mode. Sue me.<p>As you can see, the only options for controlling the scroll wheel in Windows are to tweak how <em>quickly</em> and how <em>far</em> it scrolls when you twiddle the control, but <em>not</em> direction.</p>\n<p>Grrr.</p>\n<h4>Yes. All this is the fault of Microsoft…</h4>\n<p>So, I think we can all agree that this is rather silly, has no place as an issue on computers made since 2010 (so, we’re 12 years late), and is just dirt easy to fix. And no, I don’t want any registry hacks or 3rd party utilities. It’s built into everything else, so yeah. Clearly, everyone else seems to have cracked the code, as it were.</p>\n<p>I’m not a coder on any level, but if programmers can make mistake that lose people hundreds of millions of dollars and fix that epic screwup, I’m quite sure Microsoft can add a scrolling direction option toggle to a Windows update coming sometime this year, and that’s being generous.</p>\n<p>I’d be willing to wager a farthing and a nice six-pack of gluten-free beer that a couple of their superstar hackers could whip up a fix in an afternoon. Tell “Up” and “Down” to do the opposite.</p>\n<p>Ooooooooooo! Rocket Science!!!</p>\n<p>I’d be interested in hearing how or why this would <strong><em>not</em></strong> be a feasible endeavor. Both pragmatic and loony answers are welcome. I only have two rules; have fun. be nice.</p>\n<h4>The Conclusion…</h4>\n<p>It’s time. Get it done, Microsoft.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div><hr></div>\n<div><div>\n<p>PS: The violence in America is intensifying. There are reports of mass shootings coming in daily now. The Laguna Woods shooting was just a few miles from our home. There are very clear signs that America is heading towards some kind of event or series of events that will likely change life in this country forever. I’d much rather it be a march on the Capitol for a protest of epic proportions than another mass shooting.</p>\n<p>PPS: One way we can look at this is via representation, one of the core tenets of the foundations of American society. Most Americans are represented, at least the ones who aren’t homeless, an illegal immigrant, or Black. Those should be easy red flags. Then divide them into Democratic, Independent, and Republican silos. There’s more red flags. They’re everywhere you look. We keep divvying ourselves up into little groups of people who should get more than everyone else. And we know very well that the big group with the most rabid desire is the white supremacy movement. Another is the National Rifle Association. I get it. It’s easy to get them mixed up.</p>\n<p>PPPS: When reflecting on the tragedy of these terrible times when some of our “representatives” choose to dissemble in the face of the slaughter of nineteen 9–11 year olds in the name of their god, the gun, remember that the NRA membership is less than 2 million… in a country of 330 million.</p>\n<p>PPPPS: How’s <em>that</em> for representation!</p>\n</div></div>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

Is your weapons industry suffering in the markets when there’s little direct war action to feed the coffers for your “investors”? Our simple program allows you to generate almost unlimited “excitement” for weapon, accessory, and ammunition sales.</p>\n<p>2022 has been a year of explosive growth for the gun industry, and we see nothing but profits for the ongoing future. Take a look at some of the successful results from our non-stop “marketing” campaign for “freedom”.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The continued performance of gun “enthusiasm” despite the “unintended restructuring” of the National Rifle Association and their extensive messaging platform is a huge cost savings since we no longer funnel funds into their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackerman_McQueen\" target=\"_blank\">Ackerman McQueen</a>-led AgitProp strike team. We applaud the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nra-cannot-be-dissolved-by-new-york-attorney-general-judge-rules-2022-03-02/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nra-cannot-be-dissolved-by-new-york-attorney-general-judge-rules-2022-03-02/\">NRA’s continued efforts to remain relevant</a>, however.</p>\n<p>Without further ado here are examples of “successful results” from our industry’s non-stop “marketing campaigns”…</p>\n<h3>May 24th 2022: Uvalde, TX. — Robb Elementary School — 21 murdered</h3>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<h3>February 14th, 2018: Parkland, TX. — Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School — 17 murdered</h3>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<h3>December 14th, 2012: Newtown, CT. — Sandy Hook Elementary School — 27 murdered</h3>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p><strong><em>This</em></strong> is how. You do everything in your power to get gun laws <em>relaxed</em>, if not <em>stricken entirely</em>, so that more and more guns reach more and more true, red-blooded Americans. That, however, only reaches a certain saturation point. It’s not enough that one person own one gun. They need to <em>need</em> more guns. In order for your profit margins to soar in the short term, you need a <em>catalyst</em>.</p>\n<p>You need the “Secret Sauce”; fear, uncertainty, and doubt, also known by its acronym, <em>FUD</em>.</p>\n<p>As silly as FUD sounds, it is a devastating weapon that can strike without provocation or warning, and at scale, and all without specific instruction. It’s not enough that they feel unsafe in their homes, they need to feel <em>existential</em> dread. One of the most proven methods of instilling <em>deep, unwavering</em> dread is to see their children slaughtered like fish in a barrel, repeatedly. Preferably with some breathing room in between events so we can hone our messaging. We’d also like to thank Alex Jones who has been an indispensable asset in our efforts. We wish him well in his future endeavors.</p>\n<p>One side benefit, as well, is that with so many excess guns and ammunition, a lot gets stolen, which must be replaced, which means insurance claims, and so on and so forth, providing a solid foundation for “gravy” profit margins in the peripheral markets and for suppliers. That also puts a load of guns into the “grey” and “black” markets, some of which generate more profits for us at gun shows, while illegal arms feed into the suburban, urban, crime, and minority fear secondary markets. And “Ghost Guns” are fine for now, but as they start to make headway, we’ll need to kick-off a “Vuse Maneuver” so we can leverage their work into our profit with minimal capital outlay.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*wKqviZUe1sIDjxtPig-c7A.jpeg\" title=\"Image: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*wKqviZUe1sIDjxtPig-c7A.jpeg\">As you can see here, the data is clear. Sales were distressingly low from the mid-90’s to the mid-00’s, but through our continued efforts on multiple fronts, we’ve been able to “eliminate” roadblocks to unlimited growth potential. A strong domestic weapons industry is critical. If we fail to protect this precious resource, hundreds of “Job creators” <strong>WILL</strong> continue to suffer, and we simply cannot allow that to happen.<p>You can’t leave it at that, however, you’ve got to dig deeper. You need help from the community, even if you have to manufacture consent. People are sheep. They don’t know what they need. But we, the wealthy and powerful, the ones manipulating things behind the curtains and maintaining a carefully curated veil of legitimacy, we do. Well, we know what <em>we</em> need, and in the end, that’s the only important thing we care to know. Knowing more is exhausting.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, however, we applaud this young man for his crowning achievement as 2nd Place Master Provocateur in our fight to return America to it’s “Roots”; a “colored folk” shooting range dotted with murderous, little fiefdoms teeming with happy, little aryans, bristling with their powerful, little assault rifles. Our <em>Manifest Destiny</em> is at hand, my fellow Americans!</p>\n<p>Won’t it be wonderful?</p>\n</div></div>\n<div><hr></div>\n<div><div>\n<p>In case it’s not clear, this is satire. I’m upset about Uvalde, TX. How can I not? These little babies were murdered, slaughtered like so many pigs in an abattoir, just like Parkland and Sandy Hook and thousands of others mass shootings year after year after year before, and if things don’t change, many more in the coming years. And we pretend this is a “mental health” issue, claim the time after tragedy is exclusively for grieving and discourse of any kind dishonors the recently deceased, then make deals behind closed doors and in exchange for “contributions” to give the gun industry its <strong><em>fucking</em></strong> money’s worth.</p>\n<p>A lot more than our children pay the price, as well. Just look up how many have been killed by gun violence in America in 2022 alone, and the humanists among us are traumatized because we feel emotions; the closer we are, the exponential growth in heartache. We’ve been here before, and we’ll be here again unless the people act, and that means getting out into the streets, which is what I hope we finally do.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://tylerknowsnothing.medium.com/why-outrage-doesnt-matter-anymore-35128167fa2\"><strong>Why outrage doesn’t matter anymore</strong><br><em>Here’s the thing.

I wrote another on my blog, the one that was destroyed by The-Host-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named, and no, it’s not Blue Host. I dislike them openly. I may repost it at some point. It takes a lot of work to convert from WordPress Gutenberg post formatting, so probably not.</p>\n<p>I hope we get some of this shit figured out before someone does something so stupid we can’t come back from it.</p>\n<p>I really do.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div><hr></div>\n<div><div>\n<p>PS: Depression is a deeply misunderstood ailment that often doesn’t feel real, either to people who suffer from it and don’t know or to those lucky few who’ve never been depressed, though I’m not sure the latter is possible. I’ve suffered from depression for decades now and I doubt it will ever go away, but I’ve still managed to write… at least until Covid-19 came along…</p>\n<p>PPS: My wife, daughter, and I had Covid <em>very</em> early, like in February 2020. Fortunately for us, our primary symptom was body-wide pain and we had none of the other, potential fatal problems. I’ll just gloss over the fact that I happened to get Shingles at the same time, but for those of you who know, you know. What came after, however, has been the most catastrophic symptom of my Covid infection; Long Covid brain fog. If it was already hard enough to write while depressed, Shingles kicked it up a few thousand levels of distressing.</p>\n<p>PPPS: I’ve made countless commitments to restart my writing efforts, but I’ve only managed a few spurts of activity over the last few years. I don’t know if I can change that, but I’ll damn well try. I can’t sit idly by, randomly opining on the internet while atrocities are committed on a near daily basis. I need to start being a more active participant in this great experiment gone wrong, a sentiment I hope many more Americans like myself, humanist, open-minded, pragmatic, for forward-thinking, will choose to adopt. I’ll do my best and all I can do is thank you for reading my words.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

Neato torpedo…<p>Back in 2009, I needed to have the CPU repasted in my MacBook Pro as it was running hot. Ill-advised in retrospect, I poked around Craig’s List until I settled on someone offering repair services that I felt I could trust. I spoke to him on the phone a few times, and we arranged to meet. I dropped off the laptop, we chatted jovially for about ten minutes, and then I went home.</p>\n<p>I never saw that machine again.</p>\n<p>I had been a contented Apple user since the (very) late 1970’s, but as the 2000’s wore on, my satisfaction had been whittled away by a range of issues like Apple’s pricing, the rise of the walled garden, and limitations preventing me from using non-Apple gear, of which I have a <em>lot</em>. As a working writer, the most pressing issue of the time, however, was that I had $600 to get a replacement machine so I could get back to work. It took me four years to save up the $2,400 for it in the first place and a used machine wasn’t going to cut it. I had no choice. I had to buy a Windows machine.</p>\n<p>I started with an HP ProBook I picked up open box at Microcenter for $600. It was okay. After a couple of years it became nigh unusable for my Team Fortress 2 gaming, so I got another $600 open box deal at Microcenter, this time a Lenovo Flex 3 with discreet graphics. To its credit, my wife still uses it to this day. It’s slow as hell, but she won’t give it up. Not blowing a ton of cash on these machines, however, allowed me to save up another chunk of cash and, happy with Windows 10 at the time, I dropped $1,800 on my first gaming laptop, an Alienware 15 R3 with an 8GB GTX1060 graphics card. Despite all my research, it turned out to be something of a shitbox and now sits in a drawer with a dead battery that’s really hard to replace. So, early on in the Pandemic, I bought an open box HP Elitebook 840 G6 for way less than it’s street value. And yes, it was also $600. If you’re curious, I don’t have any particular affinity for the number 600, just hilarious coincidence.</p>\n<blockquote>Just don’t buy Dell. Period. They’re crap and only care about their enterprise &amp; their hot XPS laptop, which they recently sabotaged with a hideous new industrial design. Typical Dell, am I right?</blockquote>\n<p>Now, more than a decade later, I have a new M1 Mac Mini on my desk, an iPhone 12 Mini in my pocket, and a 2013 MacBook Pro I got from a friend. Yes, I still have the HP EliteBook 840 (running the thoroughly disappointing Windows 11 which I’m planning to downgrade back to Windows 10), but I’ve barely used it since I got the Mac Mini, aside from taking the time to charge it up and make sure it has all updates. And it was an easy switch, as most of my tools are online, run from my web host or on my NAS, and/or have long been cross-platform. With a little practice I was back in the groove.</p>\n<h4>So, what prompted this sudden turn-around?</h4>\n<p>The first thing that caught my eye was the then new iPhone 12 Mini. I’d been an avid Blackberry user for years before migrating to the iPhone 4s, but when I lost my MacBook Pro to stupidity, I started trying out Android devices as they integrated better with Windows. Those early days were harsh, and after working through a range of Android devices, I eventually circled back to Blackberrys with BBOS 10 which had Android app support. I’m pretty sure you already know how that ended, which is when I bought my first truly great Android device, the OnePlus 2. Following that was an LG v30, then a Samsung A70, and saw that these things were getting too damn big. That iPhone 12 Mini spoke to me, so I bought one.</p>\n<p>Just one month later in 2020, Apple shocked the world with the announcement of the first M1-powered systems. For the second time in years, I was excited for something from Apple. After ingesting an unhealthy number of YouTube videos issuing test after test illustrating the M1's astounding superiority and efficiency after having been held in thrall by the iPhone 12 Mini for six months, I felt it was time to dip my toes back into Apple’s newly inviting waters.</p>\n<p>I pulled the trigger in early 2021.</p>\n<p>There was more to my decision-making, though. I’d been monitoring the battle between Epic Games and Apple in hopes that the Cupertino behemoth would start opening up more of iOS. I’d also acquired the aforementioned 2013 MacBook Pro from a friend and was pleasantly surprised to find that it ran the then current macOS just fine, which reminded me of Apple’s legendary reliability and long life.</p>\n<p>Microsoft had just rolled out Windows 10 to “correct” the Windows 8/8.1 Start Menu debacle and were doing all kinds of amazing new stuff. I’d come to believe that Apple and Microsoft had switched places, something like a Silicon Valley version of Freaky Friday (Phreaky Phriday would be an apropos title for the film). Microsoft’s efforts were exciting and full of promise, while Apple was building ludicrously expensive cheese graters, spending five years apologizing for the atrocious “Butterfly” keyboard, ignoring their other keyboard “innovation,” the TouchBar, figuring out more important things to remove, and not much else of interest.</p>\n<p>Apple’s moneymaker was the iPhone and from the outside looking into Apple’s legendarily opaque operations, their mobile Golden Goose appeared to receive all of Apple’s focus. The Mac had been left to Apple’s chief designer Jony Ive and his bizarre, experimentally unnecessary proclivities, which are exemplified more by the removal of features that forced the creation of new revenue streams (i.e., AirPods, removing the wall charger from iPhone boxes, etc…) than the work-a-day aspects of technological evolution. When Steve Jobs called for the removal of the floppy drive from the original iMac, it was because he predicted that the CD-ROM drive would replace the older, slower, less capacious storage medium.</p>\n<h4>Steve Jobs was right…</h4>\n<p>Why did Jony Ive, Apple’s design chief, remove the headphone jack. Were people not using headphones anymore? Were headphone jack modules too big for their thin, innovative industrial designs? Were Apple’s customers demanding true wireless earbuds? No. None of these things were true. They did it because it meant they could sell far more over-priced AirPods and make a load more money over including a cheap pair in the box. And with the removal of the charging adapter, they outright claimed it would contribute to saving the planet, when it’s just another accessory being monetized and whose packaging adds even more waste to our overflowing landfills.</p>\n<p>So, you might be asking yourself why, amid all this chaos, would I jump ship… again? I mean, if Apple is doing all this shady crap with their walled garden and taking a 30% cut of sales from the App Store and everything else, why would I again immerse myself into Apple’s “flawed” ecosystem after swimming in the warm seas of Windows for a decade? Well, for one, that ecosystem isn’t as flawed as it was in 2009. Two, it’s complicated for a raft of personal reasons I’ve already touched on. It hasn’t helped that, after a few years of reliable innovation, Microsoft itself has been sending mixed signals about their future plans, and those signals are confusing. They were doing phones, then not. They were doing ARM-based Surface tablets, then those shriveled up when their performance failed to meet expectations. They were going to bring augmented reality to the masses with the HoloLens. Where the hell’s <em>that</em> thing?</p>\n<blockquote>In my opinion, I believe that Cook and Ive had a disagreement on the ultimate direction of Apple after the six long years of the Butterfly Keyboard debacle, rising thermals from Intel parts as well as their inability to get past 10nm processes, and languishing sales that were at odds with Ive’s industrial design desires. All new systems essentially roll-back Apple’s design ethos to pre-2016 forms with the iPhone 12 cloning the wildly popular iPhone 5 and the new Late-2021 MacBook Pro’s sporting the new M1 Pro and Max chips recalling the look and, more importantly, most of the ports from the pre-Butterfly designs and ditching the TouchBar for full-size function keys.</blockquote>\n<p>I’ve long understood that corporations do what they do for themselves and their shareholders. Many of them recognize that being somewhat responsive to the needs of their customers and producing products that people actually want to buy is easier than… doing the opposite (ahem, Dell.) I’ve also come to understand that it’s all just noise. The industry is what it is, and until consumers actually speak with their wallets, something we most decidedly do <em>not</em> do, Apple and Microsoft and every other gigantic corporation will continue to do as they please. So, until we put our money where our collective mouths are, we have to base our purchasing decisions on something.</p>\n<p>Instead, we must focus on who is making the most compelling technological innovations, the chip design that takes years and years and thousands of super smart people who know math and physics and science and programming, to offer the features and forward-thinking I consider when deciding which path I’ll follow. After Microsoft has effectively abandoned any semblance of a desire to innovate to focus on reliable, consistent revenue generation, the tea leaves say that Apple’s silicon will be the one to watch for the coming decade.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*NMAPaKAL_1w0IOAiuecv6g.png\">My desktop as of today, Feb. 20th, 2022, with labels. Kinda looks like a cockpit, no?<p>I mean, come on! I’ve got a $1,500 Mac Mini on my desk that can reportedly often match or exceed the performance of a Mac Pro “Cheese Grater” costing ten thousand dollars or more! The guys over at Max Tech on YouTube haven’t been able to sell their $15K Mac Pro while performing most of their editing on a 24\" M1 iMac. It’s insane the leap in power and efficiency Apple has brought to the table, and they’ve only just started.</p>\n<h4>I’d be an idiot not to ride that wave…</h4>\n<p>Of course, I’m not everyone. I’m a writer with casual gaming tendencies. I don’t push my hardware that much anymore. Back in the early 00’s I was running a Citrix MetaFrame server in the garage office we had at the time. I’d tired of Windows and was running Caldera OpenLinux on my desktop, but still needed Windows apps to write Windows books and had $30k of Citrix’s enterprise software sitting around from a previous book, so I put it to work. Prior to that, I was using Macs exclusively, and worked on Windows material using Connectix’s Virtual PC. I’d say that at least 25% of my Windows-based work was done using systems other than Windows. Clever girl.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*pU2VSoSWS3fZtjAswnvAzg.png\">It’s hilarious that my wife found this as I am writing this article. This is an actual Beta 2 disc I used for my work on some of the books of the time. The server was running Windows 2000 Server, which was running the Citrix MetaFrame software serving Microsoft Office apps to my Caldera OpenLinux desktop system while I ran XP in Virtual PC on my PowerMac 7300/200. So very meta when meta wasn’t even meta yet…<p>Times, for better or worse, have changed, and so has technology. Whilst I remain an avid humanist and decry corporate efforts to commodify the planet and its contents for the lascivious pleasure and seemingly bottomless enrichment of the 1%, I do love me some sweet, sweet computer hardware and high-quality software. As previously mentioned, even after being separated for nigh a decade, I eased back into using macOS like putting on an old pair of comfortable shoes. All of the basics hadn’t left me, and I only needed to retrain myself on the lesser used functions involving shortcuts and modifiers. Windows did a number on me in that regard, but it’s all about getting stuff done and how little your OS gets in your way.</p>\n<p>To that end, macOS is aces. Windows has gone through many significant changes in the last twenty years. Windows 7 was the penultimate exemplar of the classic Windows UI. Windows 8, however, decided to rip off its clothes and run through City Hall with a picket sign reading “Mission Accomplished” before getting tackled by cops and made to put on pants before Windows 10 came to bail it out. But even Windows 10 couldn’t commit to Microsoft’s own legacy, and now Windows 11 is breaking everything in order to be more Apple-like. Had you not use a Mac lately, you might think that this means Windows is ultra-modern and macOS is languishing in the past, but that’s simply not the case.</p>\n<p>Using a Mac may retain the familiarity of classic System 7’s form coupled with the modern sensibilities of Mac OS 10.4 “Tiger” but it also contains a dizzying array of functionality improvements and new features. Apple simply didn’t see the need to change the basic conceit of the macOS user interface and user experience of its venerable OS. The Mac is both of the future while paying deep homage to the past. I’m inclined to think that anyone familiar with macOS of a decade or more ago should have a similar experience to mine. Microsoft, on the other hand, can’t even figure out what to do with their control panel items.</p>\n<p>Today’s application climate does, however, play a significant role. I don’t think my switch back to the Mac would have been possible without the internet’s comprehensive shift towards web-enabled and web-powered apps. As Apple has been able to maintain a 15% share of the desktop market (which includes laptops) and a large percentage of Mac users are creatives, lots of apps are cross-platform. It also doesn’t hurt that the iPhone and iPad are both juggernauts of their respective markets.</p>\n<h4>All this exposition, for what again?</h4>\n<p>When all is said and done, what is it that I now derive from the new M1 Mac Mini mounted vertically on my desk that I couldn’t have gotten from my three year old 8th Gen HP business laptop running Windows 11? Peace of mind for one. Windows 11 is a mess. Just search for “Windows 11 problems” and you’ll find an endless slew of examples. Here’s one that Forbes just posted about the other day:</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*Q05YVJrsAonxvR6yi7R1Fg.png\"><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2022/02/20/dont-install-the-most-recent-windows-11-update-yetand-other-small-business-tech-news-this-week/\" target=\"_blank\">Cool, man… Click to read the article. NOTE: You get four free reads if you don’t already subscribe.</a><p>This might even sound familiar since it seems like the vast majority of Windows updates offer some kind of flag on the field that even Microsoft can’t predict before it ushers the baby code into the dark world of uncontrolled component drivers. Is it any wonder the Redmond giant wants to clamp down on hardware diversity? Apple has been doing it for decades, and their reliability numbers are significantly better than Microsoft’s.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say Macs don’t have issues. They do, just far less frequently, at least in my experience. I generally go weeks without restarting my Macs. Windows 10 was good for a few days, but Windows 11 has been a near daily reboot cycle on the EliteBook (which has good driver support), mostly because of stupid errors, app errors, and persistent UI faults that won’t go away until you <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd\" target=\"_blank\">IT Crowd</a> the damn thing. The worst I’ve seen on the M1 Mac Mini is easily fixed with restarting the faulty app itself.</p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p>I’ve got about fifty tabs open in seven tab groups on Safari, am running eight to ten applications, have a range of support apps running in the background, and it’s just peachy. It doesn’t get loud, like, at all. I don’t think I’ve ever heard the fan. It also never slows down, no matter how much I load up the system. Everything remains perfectly responsive and if there are any faults, they’re typically from an app’s services, poor coding practices, and/or lagging online content.</p>\n<p>I’ve also not had to worry about legacy apps. Rosetta 2, the translation system that converts x86 code to ARM and back again (there’s a Bilbo joke in there somewhere) is seamless. Literally seamless. I honestly don’t know if I have any non-native apps installed. I might, and they just run. No popups, alerts, weird icon flags, or anything. I also haven’t had the need to use Windows virtualized. Sure, I had it installed in Parallels, but just to goof around in the ARM version of Windows 11. I haven’t fired it up in months.</p>\n<p>(For the record, I just did so I could update it and I’m having to wait for Parallels <em>and</em> Windows to perform all their updates before I can start using it. The entire process took half an hour, not for lack of performance, but because Windows takes forever to get anything done. Even in 2022, Windows Update chokes on its own dependencies where updates fail on the first try because something else didn’t get updated first, and this isn’t limited to Beta versions. Super fun.)</p>\n<h4>What do you tell people about upgrading to Apple Silicon?</h4>\n<p>Just do it. Unless you use one or more tools that work only on Windows in an x86 hardware environment or are a PC gamer, just do it. You don’t need to spend $1,500 like I did, either. I got 16GBs of RAM and 1TB of storage space, but I always over buy as I generally get more years of use out of the expenditure rather than getting what I need in the moment. It’s also important to understand that with Apple’s new chip architecture you are stuck with whatever RAM and storage space you select at the time of purchase as those components are now integrated into the processor.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of users will do fine with the baseline 8GBs of RAM and 256GBs of local storage. Two Thunderbolt 4 ports on the back ensure that large, high-quality external drives are fast, and they’re way cheaper than buying more storage from Apple. Here are some additional pointers about getting (back) into the Mac in the 20’s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There’s a rumored Apple Event coming on March 8th. Wait until then to see what they roll out. Any new M-series chips will be incrementally better than last gen parts, but it’s always best to get the latest hardware if you can. You will derive performance, efficiency, and feature benefits from the changes Apple makes to the previous iteration. Then again, it’s not always about the performance, but the value.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.macprices.net\" target=\"_blank\">Regularly check MacPrices.net for updates on sales</a>. It’s best to keep a tab open to the <a href=\"https://www.macprices.net/macprices-headlines/\" target=\"_blank\">Latest Deals page</a>. Base model M1 Mac Minis can get down to $650, which is a steal for a machine that will get official support for seven years and actually last longer. Seriously. Also, get AppleCare. It’s worth it because Apple makes it worth it. Be patient, and you can get open box deals for as low as $550. My Late-2013 15\" MacBook Pro is officially supported to the previous major version of macOS. That’s <strong><em>NINE YEARS</em></strong>, of support. Windows 8 and 8.1 was out for only four years, three if you count the fact that Windows 10 was released one year before Microsoft ended support for 8.1 in 2016. Windows 11 was released six years later in 2021. As of yet, we don’t know how Microsoft will arrange support for Windows 10, which works on all PCs, and Windows 11, which is only supported on PCs with TPM 2.0 modules and a few other requirements. That’s not a good look, Mr. Nadella.</li>\n<li>Do <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> buy any MacBook with a TouchBar. They were made from 2015 to 2019 and have the atrocious Butterfly keyboards which fail if you cough lightly or dust anything within ten feet (fifteen feet if the lid is closed.) The <em>only</em> exception is the 13\" M1 MacBook, and if you’re looking at that, just get a MacBook Air. Apple replaced the function keys with a touch display, and then ignored it, so its effectively useless. So, unless you plan on using it as a laptop with an external keyboard or like replacing parts frequently, just avoid them. The article below gives you a rundown of which models to avoid when shopping for used deals.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://macsx.com/which-macbooks-have-the-butterfly-keyboard/\"><strong>Which MacBooks have the Butterfly Keyboard?</strong><br><em>After introducing the Butterfly keyboard in 2015, Apple persisted with it for 4 years until mounting customer…</em>macsx.com</a><a href=\"https://macsx.com/which-macbooks-have-the-butterfly-keyboard/\"></a>\n</div>\n<ul><li>Reflect on what Microsoft has done for you lately, or <em>to</em> you if you’re in a particularly salty mood, and recognize that these are all just computers that perform tasks for you. They aren’t pantheons or ideological camps, despite appearances. They’re machines and you likely need one to perform tasks. I suggest the Mac because of their qualities and benefits over buying Windows. With a Mac you know what you’re getting. With a Windows box, god knows what they slapped into that box, or how poorly. There are plenty of pre-built PC horror stories. Laptops aren’t spared, either, as manufacturers use a wide range of parts they could get deals on, even in the same model, often making driver management a maddening crap shoot.</li></ul>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p>I recently posted a piece discussing the lowly, but highly functional keyboard shortcut and the idea that keeping your hands on the keyboard is the key to efficiency, but it also serves to illustrate yet another core advantage Apple’s macOS has over Windows.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://tylerknowsnothing.medium.com/are-keyboard-shortcuts-really-more-efficient-than-a-mouse-48b55d57c1c4\"><strong>Are keyboard shortcuts really more efficient than a mouse?</strong><br><em>As a Mac user, there is one very specific admonition from Windows and Linux users I hear frequently; too much mouse…</em>tylerknowsnothing.medium.com</a><a href=\"https://tylerknowsnothing.medium.com/are-keyboard-shortcuts-really-more-efficient-than-a-mouse-48b55d57c1c4\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>This is clearly my personal opinion, but I’ve found the Mac to be a solid, all-around, thoughtful computing ecosystem that has remained consistent for decades and reliable to a refreshing fault. While we may pay a premium, something that rankles to this day and I will complain about until Apple addresses it, you get a system that will last for many years longer than the competition. And if you care about such things, Apple products have excellent resale value, making upgrades far less onerous for your wallet. Then again, I’ve found it difficult to give up my old gear when the time comes for said upgrades. That could be why I still have a MacBook Pro from 2013 in active use and a load of my old Mac stuff in storage, including my PowerBook 145b, the machine on which I started my writing career</p>\n<h4>Apple Silicon is an evolutionary revolution…</h4>\n<p>Marketing and PR types like to sling the word “Revolutionary” around a lot when describing their marginally improved products. In many cases it’s pure hyperbole, but Apple’s ARM-based systems, starting with the M1 with it’s base, Pro, and Max variants are more than the sum of their parts. Under the hood it may be an ARMv8.4 architecture part derived from their iPhone processors, but Apple’s chip engineers have built a new architecture that leapfrogs all of the current work being done in CPUs.</p>\n<p>Intel’s 12th generation Core processors are damned fast, but to achieve that performance they suck up a ton of power to get there and fall flat when unplugged. Meanwhile, Apple’s M1’s sip 30 watts of power and perform exactly the same plugged in or on battery power and can last a day on one charge. It’s not magic and they didn’t create new technologies the likes of which we have never seen before, but they did learn from their experiences designing and improving the iPhone. And all this after Steve Jobs had vocally denied having a phone in the works at all before gleefully announcing it on stage at San Francisco’s Moscone Center in January of 2007.</p>\n<p>Those first iPhones used more standard ARM designs, but by 2010 Apple would roll out their 45nm (“thicc” in nerd parlance) A4 chip with a single 32-bit core that had been designed in-house. One decade later, the 64-bit A14 Bionic sports six performance and four efficiency cores built on a 5nm process with a quad-core GPU and a 16-core AI processor as well as a small constellation of support cores. The M1, derived from the A14 chips, can run for up to 18-hours in a $999 MacBook Air while still offering desktop-grade professional video editing functionality. If they can do that, I’m pretty sure they can handle YouTube videos and writing emails.</p>\n<p>Some people would call these innovations a “sea change,” myself included. I think if Steve were alive he would be blasé about it, having planned for it years in advance. He was prescient about so many things, removed older technologies at the right time to push the industry towards adoption of incoming technologies, and kept everything he could as close to his chest as possible to limit tipping off the competition. When Cook and Ive took on his role jointly it became clear they didn’t share Steve’s deep insight, likely born of his relentless research into coming innovations. In other words, Jobs was playing 4D chess while Cook and Ive were still trying to figure out checkers, at least until Ive left Apple to start his own design firm.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/18/executives-discuss-apple-silicon-steve-jobs-goal/\"><strong>Apple Executives Discuss How Apple Silicon Achieves Steve Jobs' Goal of 'Making the Whole Widget'</strong><br><em>In a new interview with Om Malik, Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi, marketing chief Greg Joswiak, and…</em>www.macrumors.com</a><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/11/18/executives-discuss-apple-silicon-steve-jobs-goal/\"></a>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<em>“Steve used to say that we make the whole widget.

As I spoke of earlier, the removal of the headphone jack to replace it with egregiously overpriced Bluetooth earbuds was an entirely cynical, capitalistic thing to do in the same vein as taking the charger out of the iPhone box and packaging it separately while claiming to be saving the planet, but really just creating nearly twice the landfill entrée per device sold through. (Pro Tip: You are allowed to change the box design, Apple.)</p>\n<h4>Apple’s secrecy strikes again. Microsoft suddenly flounders?</h4>\n<p>Back in the mid-2010’s, as Apple was spinning further and further away from the path Jobs had set them on, Microsoft was having a kind of renaissance with new CEO Satya Nadella who, with CPO Panos Panay’s emotionally engaging presentation style, sold us on a new age of innovation that would be issuing forth from Redmond. Windows 10 had a whole new Agile-based release process, they were working on the HoloLens Augmented Reality glasses, and talking about bringing a new (not) phone to market. They showed off hot new gear in September 2020 like the (not a phone, per se) Surface Duo and the never-shipped Surface Neo tablet while the HoloLens moved upmarket as a consumer-unfriendly enterprise device priced at nearly $5,000.</p>\n<p>Then in a November 2020 event, Apple drops a bomb; the all-new, didn’t-see-it-coming M1 chip slotted into the fanless MacBook Air and the fanned MacBook Pro 13\" and Mac Mini. The surprise event seemed sufficient to push Microsoft off course, and they didn’t correct well. With their ARM-based hardware and software initiative struggling to keep its head above the water in the ankle-deep shallows of a calm lake, Apple’s successes with their shift to Apple Silicon effectively bullied their competition into handing over their floaties. But I don’t think this indicates that Apple has any real power over Microsoft, only that Microsoft’s efforts weren’t as thought out as we’d hoped. This is nothing new, however, as Microsoft has had issues keeping the lumbering juggernaut on its tracks for many, many years.</p>\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\"><strong>Apple Event</strong><br><em>Watch the latest Apple keynote stream, and check out the archive of special event announcements for our products and…</em>www.apple.com</a><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\"></a>\n</div>\n<p>As a consumer, the take away here should be that Apple is offering a well-supported, stable, secure, and capable platform that meshes extremely well with the tens of millions of iPhones and iPads that reside in the hands of Windows users, and Microsoft has not seemed capable of correcting course in a timely manner. I don’t think these factors will cause a mass exodus from Windows, but it certainly won’t help Microsoft maintain their massive lead over Apple in the installed user base.</p>\n<h4>I know this is a lot to think about.</h4>\n<p>I think the two most important things you should take away from this are that the Internet has had a profound effect on cross-platform compatibility and that Apple is doing some amazing things. Whether they will pan out in the future is only for the future to know, but from what I see, the best bet most of us have for a real value in computing gear has started to shift from the WinTel (Windows on Intel) industry towards the Mac.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*WIgPeXZ-Jg-hhxnmwdGdoQ.png\">Apple’s traditional marketshare has been 14%. It’s now 16% while Windows has been steadily declining, something that’s easier to see with a larger data set. [SOURCE: <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide/\" target=\"_blank\">statcounter</a>]<p>Of course, Apple’s not going to jump from 16% marketshare to overtake Microsoft’s 76% anytime soon, but the Cupertino company has laid the foundation.</p>\n<p>From my perspective, that foundation’s far beefier than Microsoft’s for the foreseeable future. Let’s agree to meet up in 2032 to discuss.</p>\n<p><strong><em>PS: Let’s keep Ukraine in our thoughts. That sovereign country is being attacked by a thug who knows nothing but violence.

Ahem… Disney? Heard of ‘em? There are a number of outfits that play in that space these days. Warner, Illumination, Pixar, DreamWorks, Universal, and Sony Pictures Animation, in no particular order, are a smattering. Each studio has their own “voice” but Sony’s <em>Hotel Transylvania</em> franchise is a series of films that speaks in its own voice, and that voice is Genndy Tartakovsky.</p>\n<p>And yet, Tartakovsky’s participation in the fourth entry in the tetralogy is limited to writing the story, co-penning the script, and acting as an executive producer. Instead, the helm was handed off to co-directors Derek Drymon and Jennifer Kluska, who are both first timers in the director’s chair (that’s a big chair.) Tartakovsky wasn’t the only one to decline participation in this latest, and reportedly final, installment, either. Most notably, Adam Sandler was replaced by Brian Hull as the voice of Count Dracula and Kevin James’ Frankenstein was replaced by Brad Abrell. Trust me when I say that you won’t miss them. The replacements are almost exact matches, indicating that star power just isn’t necessary to support feature-length animation. All it does it foster bloated production costs.</p>\n<p>Sony describes <em>Hotel Transylvania: Transformania</em> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<em>When Van Helsing’s mysterious invention, the “Monsterfication Ray”, goes haywire, Drac and his monster pals are all transformed into humans, and Johnny becomes a monster. In their new mismatched bodies, Drac, stripped of his powers, and an exuberant Johnny, loving life as a monster, must team up and race across the globe to find a cure before it’s too late, and before they drive each other crazy. With help from Mavis and the hilariously human Drac Pack, the heat is on to find a way to switch themselves back before their transformations become permanent. [SOURCE: </em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9848626/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" target=\"_blank\"><em>IMDB.com</em></a><em>]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At its core, <em>Hotel Transylvania</em>is both an homage to classic luminaries of the Golden Age of animated shorts like <em>Wily Coyote</em>, <em>Tom &amp; Jerry</em>, <em>Popeye the Sailorman</em>, and even more contemporary adherents to classic animated hijinks like <em>Roger Rabbit</em> and <em>Ed, Edd, &amp; Eddy</em> (a meta turducken, if you will) and entirely its own thing, something like <em>Rush</em> is to rock music or <em>Ben Folds Five</em> is to alternative.</p>\n<h3>Nuts &amp; Bolts</h3>\n<p>As the fourth entry, <em>HT4</em> is a solid evolution of the defined art style, but it doesn’t stray from the franchises established parameters. This is no Spider-Verse and yet the color palette is rich and bright, lighting and luminance effects are excellent, and the correct application of bokeh and the lens effects bring believable depth to most scenes. It’s clear, that Sony has been working hard to refine their process. That said, some of the textures don’t look great (the rock slide in the opening musical number looks like crap) which is a big oversight on such a high-visibility production.</p>\n<p>Character designs, on the other hand, are peak franchise, hewing closely to the immutable nature of classic cartoon character design that said characters are iconic and must remain recognizable. They only change in service of a gag and always return to their pristine base form when the gag is complete. This is the same basic rule that defines all character designs from all cartoon where these icons <em>always</em> wear the same clothes, et al. Imagine Fred Flintstone wearing actual pants or Jessica Rabbit wearing something other than her signature red, sequined dress… oh. Well, not that, but you get the idea. Thanks, Disney Whitewashing Division…</p>\n<p>The story telling is solid, if a bit on the basic side, something I’d expect of Illumination’s work. It’s not bad, but it’s also not sophisticated. The comedy revolves almost entirely around the physical gags which, in turn, defines the entire film. In a film that is more a buddy adventure flick, ala the far superior <em>Emperor’s New Groove</em>, then another entry in the <em>HT</em> canon it works to a degree, but not entirely. There’s little to no meta humor that pleases both adults and kids alike, depending on your depth of knowledge. It comes down to the gag, and that gag is always a physical comedy bit. The approach takes away from the core conceit; two people coming to terms with each other by walking in each others shoes.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*VyoeNA98y7IZn8Rw.gif\">Unexpected hair loss syndrome…<p>If anything jumps out at me it’s that the film feels claustrophobic. We start in Drac’s house, then the hotel, the plane, the provincial town, the bus, the jungle, and the cave, then back to the hotel. While the story is about Johnny and Drac and their journey towards acceptance of their differences, and spending time in each others shoes, it pulls back from the more expansive world-building as exemplified in the Tartakovsky-helmed entries. Since each scene needs to serve the setup for the next visual gag, any potential avenues for additional, foundational scope and scale is ditched in favor of setting up for the next gag.</p>\n<p>And that’s where it lies; at the intersection of storytelling and spectacle, with the visuals winning over the written by a long shot. It’s not a terrible movie, to be sure, but you won’t derive much but the most deconstructed joy, the kind that makes a little kid roll around in the dirt with the giggles but generally doesn’t survive the transition to higher modes of cognition that come with age.</p>\n<p>It should be a hit for years to come as a go-to for quiet toddler mommy hours worldwide.</p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

But I’m not just a Mac peep, I’m also a Windows and Linux guy. I started as an Tandy Radio Shack kid, became an Apple ][ kid, then a PC teen, and ultimately a Mac jerk (read: young adult.) In the mid-90’s, when the public internet was spun up, I was still a Mac guy sporting a PowerBook 145b emitting a veritable thatch of SCSI peripherals. But the story gets even more complicated.</p>\n<p>When I met my wife and started my second phase of life as a writer, I was working on Windows books. Without any PCs at the time, I did all my work in Connectix Virtual PC. Later I would upgrade to a PowerMac 7300/200 and buy a cheap Packard Bell from Circuit City to act as a proxy server for our little dial-up network (and despite PB’s history of shit, it was a real workhorse for years.) Without going into more exhaustive detail, I would use Macs for many more years, then switch to Windows laptops for about a decade until the launch of Apple’s M1 Macs would draw me back in.</p>\n<p>My Linux journey began in New Mexico with Caldera OpenLinux at a time when there were few niceties, and certainly no app stores. I had to compile my own apps, and in order to do that, I had to learn how to do it all from scratch. I’ve been using one form of Linux (called a distribution, or distro for short) ever since, primarily on a Dell Venue 11 Pro tablet. My current favorite is Linux Mint, and it is light years beyond Caldera OpenLinux, a distro that passed away a long time ago amidst a raft of controversies brought about by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO_Group,_Inc._v._Novell,_Inc.\" target=\"_blank\">SCO Group’s attempt to take “ownership” of Linux</a>. tl;dr: they lost.</p>\n<p>Over the years, working with macOS, Windows, and Linux, I have developed what I would think it a more than passing level of expertise in all three of the most important operating systems. I don’t think I’m a rare bird, but I doubt that my archetype is very common at all. What this extensive experience does grant me, however, is deep insight into the user experience of these desktop systems. I think that gives me the right to say the following:</p>\n<blockquote>Keeping your hands on your keyboard, or not having to reach for your input device, increases efficiency? It’s a stupid myth.</blockquote>\n<p>I hear it all the time from most all Linux and Windows power users. Taking your hand off your keyboard to manipulate your mouse/trackball/trackpad/etc, according to these naysayers, is an enormous waste of time. A killer of efficiency, if you will. Personally, I am a trackball user. My current device is an <a href=\"https://elecomus.com/web/product/3271/\" target=\"_blank\">Elecom Huge</a> (Japanese brand, funny names) and it’s marvelous, but I digress. I have, however, used mice for years, as well, primarily for gaming. I also have a lightly used Apple Magic Trackpad. For my keyboard, I switch between a Logitech MX Keys for Mac and an Apple Magic Keyboard.</p>\n<p>I use keyboard shortcuts the least in Linux. The problem I’ve found myself facing is, that with each new epoch of Linux and with its built-in fragmentation, there is no unified set of them. GNOME and KDE have their own and some distros introduce their own, like System76’s Pop_OS!-flavored window tiling manager. And in Linux terminology the Windows/Command key is fluid, mostly due, I believe, to general saltiness over having to use the bespoke key of a proprietary OS. Unless I dedicated all of my time to Linux, I doubt I’ll ever develop real proficiency with its keyboard shortcuts. One thing that Linux nerds say all the time, however, is true; using the command line <em>can</em> be faster. I update all of my software by typing out a few commands. There is a learning curve, though.</p>\n<p>I use keyboard shortcuts about half the time in Windows. The issue with Windows isn’t that the keyboard shortcuts are a chaotic mess, but that they traditionally use the CTRL key as the primary modifier, which is stupid since you have to manipulate it with your pinkie finger. We’ve had the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_key\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Key</a> since 1994, and even to this day with Windows 11, it’s effectively useless. Cut, copy and paste all use the CTRL key, and switching windows is performed using ALT+TAB. There is a WINDOWS+W shortcut that will close “some” windows or tabs, but the default is ALT+F4. So, the world of Windows keyboard shortcuts is long established and yet it’s nearly as chaotic as the mess that are shortcuts in Linux.</p>\n<p>You saw this coming a mile away but yes, I use keyboard shortcuts the most on macOS. Part of that is a direct result of Apple’s fully-integrated environment that presents a mostly standardized set of F-keys that perform functions like media control and accessing display and navigation features. The other part comes from Apple’s dedication to Command key placement and it acting as a central modifier for all basic shortcuts. There is always one Command key to the left of the spacebar, and often one to the right, depending on the keyboard. CMD+Q quits apps. CMD+W closes a window or tab. CMD+TAB switches apps. CMD+~ switches windows in an app. CMD+[ or CMD+LEFT is browser back. Cut, copy and paste are as expected. Moving around the Finder is a breeze, too. CMD+UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT lets you navigate all windows and files without ever touching the mouse, and using SHIFT instead of CMD selects files as expected. There are dozens more, and if you add the Control, Option, and Shift keys, there are hundreds. For instance, OPT+R gets you this: ®. And yes, I used CMD+SHIFT+4 to make this screenshot which shows more.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*423sKkETtUk3BO9W.png\" title=\"Image: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*423sKkETtUk3BO9W.png\">Just a selection of the most common keyboard shortcuts for macOS.<p>Now, I realize this is starting to sound like I’m cheerleading using the keyboard and not wasting time touching my filthy (not literal) trackball to do stupid mouse tricks that would be “easier” on the keyboard, but that wouldn’t be accurate. In reality, I use my trackball far more often where it matters to me; writing and editing.</p>\n<p>Despite being able to OPT+LEFT/RIGHT to jump around with my cursor, one word at a time, I find it far more accurate to mouse to the edit insertion point. Think about it… a mouse pointer is an extension of your hand-to-eye coordination. When you are accustomed to your input device, the pointer goes to where you look. This combination is, as Steve Jobs predicted, is key to a fast and efficient user experience. There are no keyboard shortcuts to make the cursor jump to where you’re looking, at least not yet. Imagine spotting a typo two paragraphs above where you’re writing. Now, get to it with your keyboard, then with your mouse. How much time did you spend doing each?</p>\n<p>I think the difference is stark, and clearly in favor of a mouse.</p>\n<p>Ultimately your experience will be your own or, in internet parlance, your mileage may vary. It all comes down to how you use your computer and the level of proficiency you have developed in one or more operating systems. It’s quite clear that macOS is where I feel most comfortable, and I would argue that most people who haven’t already used a Mac would come to the same conclusion if you could transition seamlessly. But, we all know that’s not yet a thing, much like flying cars or setting up a new Android phone with the click of a button.</p>\n<p>To the question of efficiency, I think the idea that keeping your hands on your keyboard is the single most efficient use case is bullshit. I’ll admit that I’m likely biased because I use a trackball. It’s always in the same place and never moves, making it a lot easier to get my hand on it. The very large track ball makes it easy to get the mouse pointer exactly where you want it (see the link to the Elecom Huge above), and I don’t think very many people believe clicking a mouse button is difficult (I’m not including people who actually do find it difficult and need accessibility tools to help them.) Even so, any mouse, trackpad, or trackball leverages hand-to-eye coordination, and I think that’s a hard combo to beat when it comes to general computer navigation.</p>\n<p>So, to all you keyboard masters out there who can fly around a computer never touching a mouse, kudos to you, but I don’t think the vast majority of the billions of computer users have the same experience. The combination of familiarity in your operating system and a good quality input device is the way almost all of us interact with our systems. That’s all I have to say on that.</p>\n<p><em>PS: Voting rights. Seriously, voting rights. Can’t hear me? VOTING RIGHTS.</em></p>\n<p><em>PPS: What will you do when you’re not allowed to vote because you mailed in your ballot a little late and any buffer time was removed or you can’t vote by mail any more?

Here it is, mostly unedited, for your potential enjoyment/derision. -Ed.</i><br></p>\n<p>I often tell this story when ferrying people around and the subject of jobs come up. A long time ago, I used to get really mad at people who didn't follow through on their commitments. In consulting and IT work, my targets would often be vendors and service providers. I would angrily tell them how they were violating the terms of their contract and, due to their incompetence, were costing my client money for every minute they continued to fail at their singular job. <br></p>\n<p>Needless to say, most vendors didn't like me. Shocking, I know. </p>\n<p>As a child I'd heard, among many others, the old saw of not putting the horse before the cart. When you think of it literally, it makes functional sense. After all, the cart can't pull the horse. However, when you shift the perspective on the term \"put\", the axiom takes on a wholly different meaning. Don't think of \"Put\" as a positioning directive, but a values one. I had an epiphany one day where what I had been told by dozens, if not hundreds, of people all came crashing in on me to make sudden sense. <br></p>\n<p>I suddenly understood that you put the horse's needs before the value of the products you have in the cart because, without the horse, you can't get the valuables to market. <br></p>\n<p>We know what happens when horses are abused. Surprisingly, horses don't like being abused, but I wasn't putting the service providers horse in front of my client cart, I was abusing it. It was in that moment that I decided I would dramatically change how I dealt with vendors, which would lead me to a completely new way of dealing with people in general. It's called RESPECT. <br></p>\n<p>I made myself hyper-self-conscious about how I would talk on the phone and started actively forcing myself to be nice, respectful, and patient. It wasn't easy. I was pushing my brain to behave in ways it was unaccustomed, but I recalled how I had taught myself to whistle very loudly with my fingers when I was nine. It took me three days and almost all of my free time, but I did it, and there was no skin in that game. I saw my schoolmates do it and badly wanted it myself. I applied the same focus to my new/old problem. <br></p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, I found that I got far more positive results almost immediately, and some queries regarding what I'd done with Tyler and could they expect <i>that</i> Tyler to be on hiatus permanently. These direct results were the spurs I needed to dive in more, and over a few weeks I was able to make it an easy part of my daily interactions. The process of respect became my daily driver. It took another year or two for it to seep into my life overall, but it did, with some exceptions. Suffice it to say, absolutes do not exist. One could even say that the absence of absolutes is the only true absolute. <br></p>\n<p>Mind. Blown.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n</div>\n",

If the image above wasn't enough to convince you of the sheer janky-ness of this \"concept\", check out the lede from the official press release:<br></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>A leading platform for fandoms and online communities has partnered with an independent bedmaker to create the ultimate ‘TV Binge Bed’. The ‘TV Binge Bed’ includes self-cleaning sheets, a ‘Netflix and Chill’ setting, and for those who don’t want to leave their bed at all, an optional built-in potty. The expected retail price of the bed is from $14,999 (£11,321). The unique product is being developed after the platform found that the amount of time individuals spend in bed bingeing their favourite shows has increased by almost a third (31%) since 2020*.</em></p>\n<cite>- The offending Press Release, 2021. Word for word...</cite>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My first question is, what is an \"independent\" bedmaker and why not name them? And it's not a stretch, knowing the website this is coming from, that 31% of the 1,000 respondents to their survey would want something like this as it was, I am sure, described. And yes, they <em>are</em> asking $15,000 for a product clearly designed by a teen in the throughs of puberty with enough experience in Adobe Photoshop to be dangerous and not enough sense to ask logical questions. Take this line from the body of the presser: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[REDACTED] is offering the unrivalled bingeing experience with the luxurious four-poster king size bed that also includes a smart 32-inch flat screen TV, built-in surround sound speakers, folding trays, charging points, and places for storing food and ‘private things’.</p>\n<cite>- Mega Ultra LOLZ0rz</cite>\n</blockquote>        <div class=\"posthaven-gallery\" id=\"posthaven_gallery[1799085]\">\n                  <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/2732688/Uv46xl3khsX1sRlaB_H0Lbg5cTY/BingeBed-1.jpeg\">\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/2732689/OWm-TqK_t9a95KWquM9SVyNMMAA/BingeBed-2.jpeg\">\n        </p>\n\n        </div>\n<p>This is simply ridiculous. How would anyone other than the obscenely wealthy justify purchasing such a ludicrous bed based solely on these hideous Photoshop mock-ups? How is it the makers think that a stupidly tiny 32” flat-panel smart TV would be attractive to anyone who binge watches enough television to warrant spending $15k on a bed with an (optional, mind you) toilet? They even know the dimensions of a King-size bed, for crying out loud, and even taking the four-poster configuration, they should easily be able to fit a 55”, or maybe even a 60” set in that space. </p>\n<p>Then there’s the <em>starting</em> price of $15k. That’s truly obscene. 55” OLEDs are going for about $1,500 on Amazon. So, where’s the $14,000 go? You can get four-poster bed frames for well under $1,000. All of the gizmos and cubbies are effectively nothing compared to the mattress, which can cost a few thousand alone. Decent surround soundbar systems are around $500, though you can spend more. Then there’s the toilet, which is completely beyond me why they would add this other than to have people like me talk about it, only costs a little over $100.</p>\n<p>So, screw math and all that. This only works out to about $6,000-8,000, tops, and that’s with the fix for the shit TV they’re offering!</p>\n<p>This sounds more like a capitalist's fever dream rather than a legitimate product. </p>\n<p>PS: I’m not mentioning the PR firm or company offering this because I don’t want to give them any PR, but merely point out the insanity of it all. I’m sure it won’t be hard to figure out what website is behind this, but I’m not going to contribute. </p>\n<p>PPS: Reading for the day, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/black-woman-white-privilege-racism_n_61ae133ee4b07fe2012a3f67\" target=\"_blank\">I’m Black but look white. Here are the horrible things white people feel safe telling me</a>. Humanity is what you make of it, and America has a sizable population that makes it terrible for Black people. I imagine if white people had been enslaved and oppressed for hundreds of years, they’d likely feel differently. Instead, we continue to “allow” this to happen. ALL Americans who believe in equal rights need to stand together. Unfortunately, almost none of us stand for anything aside from the shade we post on social media. </p>\n<p>PPPS: Social media is not a replacement for social justice. -Ed.</p>\n</div>\n",

We are, after all, heading for a rather dramatic shift in human thinking. We need to figure out how we humans are going to formulate our societies as soon as we have self-driving vehicles of all stripes, artificial intelligence running everything, smart grids that deliver all manner of clean energy, and robots that deal with all manner of work. We will be living in a version of the dystopian we’ve all seen in movies, but it won’t be quite so dystopian.</p>\n<p>It will be a world without work.</p>\n<p>Of course, that won’t happen overnight, and the way our future unfolds will come down to what we do as the human race in the next 20–30 years. Believe me, you, that’s not nearly as long as you might think. I turned around yesterday and was rather shocked to discover I’m 49! It seems only yesterday that I was watching Star Trek (well, it actually was yesterday, but that’s not what I’m getting at.) And it’s really Star Trek that forms the core of my ideas around what a world without work would look like.</p>\n<p><b>A World Without Work, Not A World that Doesn’t Work</b></p>\n<p>So, Star Trek. If you go back and watch all of The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, Voyager, the theatrical films, you will… have watched a lot of media… but you will also have noticed something interesting. Every once in a while, there are discussions of money and jobs and values. Well, there’s a lot of talk about values, so mostly the rare bits about money and jobs are the important thing for this discussion, though it dovetails nicely into values.</p>\n<p>You see, in the Star Trek future, Earth no longer has jobs or currency. Now, it’s important to note that there is no real discussion about how this arrangement operates (though such a discussion may exist in the books, which I haven’t read), so we really only have the glimmer of a wonderful future where everything is clean and safe and educated and includes space travel and science, and all manner of amazing things.</p>\n<p>How?</p>\n<p>It’s actually rather simple, which is why it’s surprising that there is no visual Trek canon (cannon?) that covers even the basic details. Now, this is where it gets a bit knotty, because it’s all about democratic socialism, and I mean that in its purest sense. The Trek future of the Federation and most things are really good is because everyone decides that life is best managed when everyone shares in the growth of that civilization.</p>\n<p><b>No Jobs But Stuff Still Gets Done?</b></p>\n<p>From a deeply philosophical place in the minds of people who think for a living comes the idea that people organize, make things, make scientific advances, run restaurants, clean up garbage, create art and music, work in office jobs, manage stuff, and build things big and small because they are good at it and it needs to get done.</p>\n<p>Here’s a hint: Take the money out of it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzj7Wg4DAbs\">First, go listen to Yuval Harari over at TED</a>. He’s a fascinating guy and what he has to say makes a load of sense. (If you make it to the end, which I really hope you do, just know that I don’t necessarily agree with his ideas about drugs and video games.)</p>\n<p>Now that you’ve done that, do you see it?! I think you do. That’s because money is a wondrous, danger-filled myth that creates the entire scope of power and control in this world, and it only works that way because we let it. This fiction, like so many others we have created over thousands of years, is very, very powerful. Yes, we all believe in money, but it’s not like a religion. It’s more like the air we breathe. And, much like air, if you take money away, we die.</p>\n<p>So, we work.</p>\n<p>Since money is the core tenet of our global belief in its myth, we must trade our sweat in order to get some. This creates another fiction; power or, if you prefer, control. Those with the most money have the most control and, as we can see today, that control is a very destructive force, so we need to get rid of it, but if we do that, then there’s no more work. Right?</p>\n<p>Not exactly. Humans are resourceful and we have a number of inherent traits that guide us towards the sense of safety, contentedness, and fulfillment we all desire. When we are hungry or thirsty, we eat and drink. When we want to explore some new place, we screw up the courage and we set out. When we need to get across a large body of water to find what’s on the other side, we build boats. When we want to get from one continent to another, we build planes. When we want to find out what’s in that inky black over our heads, we build space ships.</p>\n<p>We are, as a large group of like beings, insanely inventive and resourceful, and that is the key to a work without work. That former work will become desires, and there will always be people who will want to fill the roles we need to make society operate as a whole. You want a salad bowl? Someone will make one for you our of wood or pottery or glass. You want to design a new kind of space craft to get to Mars? Someone will learn everything it takes to do that for you, if you let them learn how without restriction.</p>\n<p><b>It’s The Values, Stupid</b></p>\n<p>The foundation of our success in a post-work global society will be values. We all need to get on the same page when it comes to how we will organize to produce everything we do now, and more, but without currency being the driving force. That brings us back to Star Trek. How do they do it, in this fictional universe of the future? They just do it. I know that sounds simplistic, but it’s really at the core of this entire argument.</p>\n<p>There will always be people willing to do something, anything, to not be stuck at home watching TV or playing video games or taking drugs all day long. In universal basic income studies in more forward thinking countries that ours they are finding that the preponderance of participants who have all of their basic needs met, go out and get a job or volunteer instead of just sitting on their asses. So, yes, it’s true that some people will choose to do nothing, but even the smallest samples have shown that most people cannot.</p>\n<p>That is a core value.</p>\n<p>The shape of our societies won’t really change all that much. There are those fictions that are quite successful because they work, are inclusive of all people, and don’t rest on the idea that power is the only thing of value in this world. Universal healthcare is one such result, and it is common in most first-world countries on Earth, and even most second-world countries float some kind of healthcare-for-all.</p>\n<p>But what do we do with people who make things? That’s also surprisingly easy. Let’s say Julia is an forklift operator at an appliance plant just outside of Riverside, CA. She gets up at 7AM every, Monday through Friday, and heads in to the plant to start her shift at 8:30. She works until Noon, takes lunch with some co-workers at a local sandwich shop, and gets back to work at 1PM to move around more large palettes of sheet metal. She wraps up her day at 5:30 PM, stops at the grocery to pick up her food order, and goes home.</p>\n<p>At no point during the day did Julia ever pay anyone for anything and she wasn’t paid a dime for her work. Yet, that evening, she can go on a date with her fiance to a nice restaurant and go see a movie. How is this possible? It is possible through a sharing economy that involves zero money anywhere. Everyone she meets during her day has a nice home to live in, access to all the food they want, and no limitations on the kinds of recreation they can consume. There is no ownership, per se. Yes, Julia “owns” her home, but that’s because she selected the home she wanted to live in and it was available. She can keep the home as long as she likes, or choose to move somewhere else and live there.</p>\n<p><b>No, It’s Not Communism</b></p>\n<p>At its root, Communism is based entirely around money. In the old CCCP (that’s Communist Russia, to you Millennials), the government owned everything and “evenly” distributed it to the citizens. The reality was that there was no equality and there was an enormous amount of paranoia instilled in the populace in the name of control and fear, but that’s beside the point. A world without work where people do what they choose to do, learn as much as they want, and contribute to the betterment of society as a whole is not the same thing.</p>\n<p>For our new society, we’d need to get rid of a few things for it to work. Here are some of those things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Homelessness</li>\n<li>Inequality of all kinds</li>\n<li>War</li>\n<li>Famine</li>\n<li>The lack of access to healthcare for many, many millions</li>\n<li>Oppression</li>\n<li>Dictatorships and monarchy</li>\n<li>Genocide</li>\n<li>Ethnic cleansing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No, that doesn’t mean that we get rid of homelessness by getting rid of the homeless. We put them in homes. Voila! No more homelessness. Some of the other things will, of course, require more complex solutions, and there’s a lot of work to be done to start moving in this direction, but if we all just believe, we can make it happen.</p>\n<p>So, now that I’ve realized I’m starting to ramble and this is my first essay on this new blog, I’m going to wrap it up here. What are some of the things we can start doing now that will lead us in the right direction for a more positive, inclusive, and constructive future where we follow our dreams and can actually have them come true? What are some of the six billion things I left out because I’m a monkey in a tree who only desires a banana?</p>\n<p>Let me know, and share this around. It would be nice to see some of the ideas presented here start to infect more people :)<br></p>\n</div>\n",

They cost real money, but they’re available everywhere for all kinds of mobiles and at every conceivable price point. When it comes down to it, consumers will select the style and price that fits their circumstances and financial wherewithal. Hell, a lot of Chinese phone makers include a (cheap) case in the box that I’m sure a handful of people around the globe actually use.</p>\n<p>When I received a press release from Illusion Photograph offering me a review sample of one of their phone cases, I told them up front that they should focus on getting samples to more visible outlets. They insisted, so I did some research and, after learning their story, acquiesced.  They sent me a Route 66 case for my iPhone 12 mini, and this, in a way, is a review. So, here it is…</p>\n<p>The case comes in a zipper lock sleeve, has a lovely print applied, is glossy, and fits snugly onto my phone. It has cutouts on the top and bottom edges to better facilitate edge swiping, and the button cutouts prevent unintended button mashing while retaining easy access. In other words, it’s a lovely, but otherwise unremarkable case. </p>\n<p>Not exactly enough for a full post, but that’s not really the point. Here’s the email I sent Beatrice, the owner of Illusion Photograph and co-founder of the <a href=\"http://LivingHeart.co\">LivingHeart.co</a> charity that illustrates the actual point:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i><b>Beatrice,</b></i></p>\n<p><i><b>Tell you what, you can send me a case, but a case is a case. I’d prefer to profile you and your efforts to raise funds for Living Heart. Your words on your website are moving. I fear for the future and my heartache is endless as I worry for our most vulnerable, no matter where they live, how they live, or what they look like. A human is a human. Full stop. And yet we struggle to make any real head-way in human rights around the world.</b></i></p>\n<p><i><b>So, sure. You can send me a case and I’ll give it a nod, but the piece will be about you and your work and your ongoing efforts to find yourself. I fight daily for the same thing, so I feel you. </b></i></p>\n<p><i><b>Sincerely,</b></i></p>\n<p><i><b>Tyler</b></i></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I believe I’ve made transparent (see what I did there?), they sent me a case for free and I was planning on posting a piece about their charity. What I would also like to make clear is that I’m doing this for the charity. My only hope is that people either buy cases or donate to the charity. </p>\n<p>This seems like a good time to talk about the charity itself. This video, produced in 2012, pretty much covers everything you need to know about how your generous donations are spent. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most charities focus on much larger targets with narrow goals, but what I believe are the core strengths of Living Heart are its tight focus on a small region of Peru, the education and nutrition of the children of those remote communities, the care to honor and promote local traditions (read: NOT colonialism), and the teaching of sustainable skills instead of just dropping off supplies. By not expanding outward in an attempt to serve more and more communities, the charity can focus its efforts and realize real change in these impoverished regions. Note in the video when they talk about donations of warm clothing they say can be worn underneath the culture’s traditional garb. There’s a level of detail and cultural sensitivity in that you don’t see a lot of. </p>\n<p>I urge that you give, or buy a case or five, and/or tell your friends and family to give what they can. I’ll be donating the value of the case I received once I’ve got the spare cash because I think that’s not only fair, but a responsibility I have to my fellow humans on this <a href=\"https://www.livingheart.co/post/the-pandemic-is-making-the-world-more-unequal\" target=\"_blank\">ever-increasingly miserable rock</a>.  </p>\n<p>No one has ever asked to be born who they are. We just get the luck of the draw, and these kids aren’t at fault for living in poverty, and by extension their parents. Society has a long, dark history of discrimination and segregation and classism in the extremes, and these Peruvian communities high in the Andes are an example of that. </p>\n<p>I think Living Heart is doing something very important here. We should all pitch in. </p>\n<p>Happy New Year…</p>\n</div>\n",

You know, the one who thinks the world owes you, and that you owe the world nothing in return because, 'MERICA, FUK YEH, but the sad reality is that you've done little, if anything, to make America \"Great\", like ever. You couldn't be bothered to find your own place and carve it out with your own hands. Instead, you made a bunch of other people do it all for you, you know; the slaves, and that's just pathetic. I hope, however, that you choose a different path, one that involves marching with a load of like-minded peeps and letting our elected state and federal government officials know that we know they aren't doing it right. </p>\n<p>I certainly don't want people to suffer, regardless of the reason (no matter how much I might desire it for some... ahem, people), and that's precisely what we are doing when we don't stop our leaders from doing terrible things as our proxy. We do that in several ways, but some of the most effective are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Call your CongressPeeps</strong> - Get on the phone. Tell them how you feel. Finding the number is easy. Just use this fancy new Internet thingy...</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You can send them letters, too!</strong> - Did you know that, despite being hobbled by Trump appointee Louis DeJoy, the USPS still delivers letters? Try writing one... on paper. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>March</strong> - If you hear about a protest in your area, head over. Talk to people who seem to know what's going on and ask if it's not obvious. Help out. Work phones as needed. Get your friends and family involved. BE A PART OF SOCIETY. Shockingly, most of that isn't done on the internet, but in person. Also,<strong><em> </em></strong>don't be a Chad or Karen and <strong><em>WEAR A FUCKING MASK</em></strong>. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Volunteer</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Volunteer\" target=\"_blank\">Lend a hand to some group or organization that needs a hand</a>. There are loads of homeless shelters and soup kitchens, or if you like tech there are lots of places like <a href=\"https://www.freegeek.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Free Geek</a>. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>VOTE</strong> - Don't let anyone stop you, any rule silence your voice, any crass attempt to remove your status as an American with the Right to Vote bestowed upon each citizen of this land by our Constitution be quietly stripped from you in the dead of night. Yeah! It says it right in there, too! Words. Aren't they just neato?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we do nothing, we'll lose this country to those who have no qualms lying, cheating, stealing, killing and raping to get there. Over 650,000 Americans dead from Covid because Trump lied. America in a war with the Taliban for twenty years because Bush lied. I'm sure there are more lies that have been told by more presidents, but I'm exhausted and can't be bothered to look them up. </p>\n<p>In the end, I'm not entirely sure what this post is. I'll post more. Maybe.</p>\n<p>PS: Please don't get mad if I left an issue out. There are many. COUNTLESS. I can't remember what I had for breakfast, much less the endless march of atrocities against human lives. Sorry.</p>\n</div>\n",

Sure, Gerard Butler was a staple in mid-budget action flicks, but this dumpster fire isn’t one of his better ones, and it’s not going to inject any enthusiasm into prospects for his ongoing career.</p>\n<p>BUDGET: $35 million BOX OFFICE: $47.5 million (worldwide)</p>\n<p>Directed by Ric Roman Waugh and written by Chris Sparling, this schlocky disaster flick wannabe already instills a sense of dread before you cue it up after seeing that the movie poster proudly proclaims the movie is from “the” producer of the John Wick franchise, The Town, and Clash of The Titans (that monster hit… get it.)</p>\n<p>When was the last time you were excited to see the latest film from your favorite producer?</p>\n<p>Look, I’ve tried to write a simple summary of the plot, but it doesn’t make any sense. Gerard Butler’s insipid delivery as structural engineer John Garrity fares as well as expected when joined by the phoned in crap from Morena Baccarin (wife Allison) and Scott Glenn (Allison’s father Dale) and the obligatory kid, played by Roger Dale Floyd. There’s nobody else of note in the film. I’m rather surprised that these three agreed to sign on, but such is the lack of quality in Hollywood these days.</p>\n<p>The basic rundown is as follows: John and Allison are in a bad way, but it’s not made clear why. We also learn that a comet is going to just barely miss Earth, then some of it’s going to hit, then all of it’s going to hit. That’s when John gets a call from the government that tells him he’s been selected to survive if he can get his family to a nearby military base before the end of the day. A lot of stupid shenanigans ensue, they get separated, and they get back together, and they survive. The end.</p>\n<p>Big whoop.</p>\n<p>Simply put, it’s a waste of time. The pacing is acceptable, but there are a lot of story elements that just feel slapped on, like generic tropes strung together to approximate an actual story. There’s zero recognizable character development, especially for Gerard Butler’s role. He’s not developed as a real, feeling, engaging, desperate human. His life circumstances bring no stakes. He’s not redeemed in the end. He doesn’t learn any harsh lessons. He’s just an unadorned avatar. The same applies to Baccarin and Glenn’s characters.</p>\n<p>Multiple planes in the sky are clearly copy-pasted. The fires in the neighborhoods are way too big. The compositing is sloppy. Shots throughout are amateurish. All of it lacks any real energy, something I’m pretty sure is necessary for a disaster film. Hell, I’d bet real money that the Greenland shots are stock.</p>\n<p><strong>The Takeaway: </strong>Don’t bother.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

The good news is that, through the power of positive thinking, you can have anything* you want, as long as you know <em>the</em> secret.</p>\n<p>What is <em>the</em> secret?</p>\n<p>Well, it wouldn’t be much of a secret if I didn’t drag this unnecessarily hyperbolic exposition out for as long as humanly possible only to tell you something ludicrously obvious at the end, would it? In order for <em>the</em> secret to actually work, you’ll need to tolerate a lot of extraneous narrative that leads you to the very narrow conclusions I, the author, want you to “discover” for yourself. So, how am I going to do that? Easy. We start at the beginning…</p>\n<h3>The Problem</h3>\n<p>You’re stuck in a rut. You’re spinning your wheels. You can’t get a grip? You’re running out of gas? Running on empty? Any other car related metaphors I might have missed?</p>\n<p>We eventually all get there. (Don’t worry teenagers, you’ll get you chance.) We hit a wall and feel like we’re going nowhere, especially during a pandemic with everything shut down. Now we’re working at home, dealing with the kids 24/7, finding it difficult to focus, missing deadlines, or just knocking off altogether. It’s especially difficult if, like me, you are old and don’t work.</p>\n<p>As a (not) celebrated author, I’ve had my share of slumps. You would too over twenty years and a hundred books. Now that that industry is dead, I’ve moved on to… other engagements. I worked in IT for a number of years, my wife and I consulted for many years, I worked with a few firms in and around LA, and I sold my interesting skill set to anyone who would spare $25 an hour after the Great Recession.</p>\n<p>Now, at 52, after five years of soul-crushing rideshare driving. now in the middle of a global pandemic, at the (hopefully) end of the reign of an American Idiot, at the top of a new year that’s starting off with a bang, after what was already the Year from Hell, I’m on… sabbatical.</p>\n<p>And on that sabbatical, I’m trying to write. I have the perfect project that has the potential to go on for years, but I’m having trouble getting started. It all feels way too big and I can’t settle on an organization tool and there are too many new videos to catch up with on YouTube and whatever else bullshit excuse I can concoct to distract me from getting started. I’ve got the domain and the website and everything ready to go, I just need to write the content.</p>\n<p>So, since I was too lazy to do that, I came up with a plan to fix it, and this is it.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Personal Assessment</h3>\n<p>The first step in any self-improvement process is to assess yourself. Let’s take a quick little test. For every “YES” answer below give yourself one point. Let’s see how many points you have at the end and what that means?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Give yourself a point if you are breathing.</li>\n<li>Give yourself a point if you have a pulse.</li>\n<li>Give yourself a point if you know or can determine the time and date.</li>\n<li>Give yourself a point if you can move one or more of your limbs.</li>\n<li>Give yourself a point if you can see, touch, or smell anything on or around you.</li>\n<li>Give yourself a point if you are reading this.</li>\n<li>Give yourself a point for every language you can use to communicate with others.</li>\n<li>Give yourself a point for taking this quiz.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, what did your total come to? Check the chart to see your starting point:</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*MwtJzgypgThrLnd80a3j_Q.png\" title=\"Image: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/1*MwtJzgypgThrLnd80a3j_Q.png\"><p>Now, things start to get exciting as we get a sense of who you are going to be as you advance through the program. Don’t get too excited, though, as this first result is merely a baseline; the starting line that will help you form the foundation of your exciting new life.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Recognizing Your Talents</h3>\n<p>Now that you’ve established that you are, at the very least, a human being, you can move on to Step 2 where we’ll work on identifying the skills you already possess. These skills, once recognized, will be crucial elements on your path to discovering <em>the</em> secret, which you can then apply in your life to achieve unknowable results.**</p>\n<p>Isn’t it <em>thrilling</em> to be unaware of what the future holds?</p>\n<p>What skills, then, will you bring to the table? How will you participate in daily human life? How will you contribute? Select at least two skills from the following list of common traits that best apply to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can see/touch/smell/taste at least one thing on or around your body.</li>\n<li>You can move from one place to another within a frame of time.</li>\n<li>If you make an audible noise around other people, some of them may react.</li>\n<li>At various times during any given day, you consume food and/or fluids…</li>\n<li>…and your body takes in nutrients and ejects waste as needed.</li>\n<li>You are aware of your self and acknowledge it in this space and time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may be surprised to discover that all of these traits are all found in amazing people. You might also be surprised to find that you relate to all the listed traits. That’s normal and merely indicates that you are well on your way to mastering being an amazing person! Better yet, it indicates that you are well equipped for your journey</p>\n<blockquote><em>Chance favors the prepared mind.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote><em>- Louis Pasteur</em></blockquote>\n<h3>Step 3: Finding Your Center</h3>\n<p>This will be the least concrete segment of the overall process. You can’t just point to it, your center. It doesn’t exist in physical space. It’s the one thing that makes you the happiest, whether you’re able to do it now or ever have before. It’s the fulfillment of who you believe you are in and of that moment.</p>\n<p>Have no fears. This isn’t permanent.</p>\n<p>Dreams can change, and yours likely will over your lifetime. Though some settle into their dreams rather easily and with little fuss, most of us have the wrestle around a bit to find a good fit. The good news is that this can happen at any age AND you’re already on your way towards becoming an amazing person, so…</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Look deep inside yourself.</li>\n<li>Find that one thing that makes you the most happy.</li>\n<li>Focus on it until it becomes clear.</li>\n<li>Do it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That’s right…</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Do It</h3>\n<p>Yes. There’s nothing more. Just do it. Do the thing you love. Now, I grant that, during a pandemic, not everyone will be able to just do whatever it is they love. I get that. In those cases, do the first thing you love that <em>won’t</em> get someone else killed.</p>\n<p>Once you’re satisfied that you’ve done that thing you love to the greatest extent possible, move on to the next dream. In fact, keep coming up with new dreams. There’s nothing and nobody stopping you. And, one fantastic feature is that you aren’t limited in any way on how you can make your dreams come true.</p>\n<p>That’s right! YOU decide when and where your dreams come true. Funny that.</p>\n<p>Just be mindful that, somewhere nearby, someone else is making their dreams come true. The last thing you’d want is some asshole barging in on your dream. Why do the same to someone else? And who knows, maybe your dream involves helping someone else with their dream. This would be an awesome opportunity to house two birds with one nest.</p>\n<p>What qualifies as a dream? Anything, really. How many things make you happy? I can think of quite a few, but only one gives me ultimate joy; bringing joy to a reader through the written word. You could build a bookshelf. Write some letters to people who are important to you. Craft a new business plan. Fly a radio controller airplane. Sew masks for your family, neighbors, and friends. Feed hungry families. Sleep in a hammock. Hang your fresh laundry out to dry on a breezy Fall afternoon. Can some peaches. Gild a lily. Knit a sweater. Write a rock song. Battle some orcs. Tie ribbons on porcelain dolls. Hunt for old video game gear at local thrift shops. Paint religious scenes on match heads. Go fishing. Lobby for human rights. Arrange flowers. Re-pack the read-end on an old Ford truck. I don’t know. You’d know better than I.</p>\n<p>Seriously. It’s not rocket science.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: What Happened To Becoming Amazing?</h3>\n<p>If, and I stress IF, you followed the steps precisely, you will have already transformed yourself into an amazing person. You’ll know when. If you haven’t done anything yet and skipped ahead, you’ll only find the disappointment of the reality that there is no simple solution to this problem.</p>\n<blockquote><em>It’s not someone else’s problem to fix. This is all on you.</em></blockquote>\n<p>Now, that doesn’t mean you can’t have help or support from anyone. Happiness isn’t a solo endeavor, it’s a team sport. Humans thrive best in social climes. So, yes, it’s on our shoulders to work on our problems, but we’re not alone. We can leverage any resources necessary (and legal) to achieve happiness. Hell, it’s even enshrined in the Constitution of The United States of America as a key human pursuit.</p>\n<p>In the end, whoever you are most comfortable being is the most amazing you there is, and you should strive to be <em>that</em> you as much as possible. And the easiest way to do that, is to do you.</p>\n<p>That’s all anyone should ever ask of you. Everything else is gravy.</p>\n<p>Oh, and <em>the</em> secret is <strong><em>you</em></strong>.</p>\n<p><em>* by “anything” I mean anything (i.e., factor, value, trait, etc…) you already have but don’t yet acknowledge in yourself.</em></p>\n<p><em>** Unknowable results, by there very nature, are unknowable. Therefore, we cannot predict the outcomes of any efforts to find your amazing self. We do, however, know that, in the end, you’ll be an amazing person! You already ARE!!</em></p>\n</div></div>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

He was staunchly anti-war and would always stand up for the little guy. Well, mostly always…</div>\n<div><div>\n<p>My sister summed it up best.</p>\n<p>“I haven’t seen him in so long, he’s already been dead to me,” she said, or something like it. You get the point.</p>\n<p>I was watching a video on YouTube about the new Anbernic RG351M when it paused itself. Then my phone rang. I could see it was my sister from the image that appeared on the display. I knew at that moment that she was calling me to tell me dad had died. She had texted me the day before letting me know that he was in hospice at home.</p>\n<p>This was a marked change from years past. When my older sister died in the early 2000’s, I learned two weeks later, by letter from my father. Years later, when my mother had moved back to Southern California from Knoxville and would subsequently die of dementia, I was told about that a week late. When I figured out that my father had a degenerative brain disease and was likely going to die from it, I figured the same would happen when he did.</p>\n<p>You see, our step-mother has been keeping us away from our father. Why, I couldn’t tell you. My sister and I agree that they likely planned it together, but I’d need more information before I were to make an educated judgement. There are loopholes in some of the timing elements that I’ll need to look into.</p>\n<p>This, however, should illustrate the issue. I’m not sad my father has passed. No, I’m more concerned about the apparent shady behavior of our step-mother. Like my sister said, it’s like he’s been dead, but it’s taken everyone else a few years to figure out.</p>\n<p>We expected it.</p>\n<p>Like I knew that seeing my sister on my caller ID meant that he had passed. Like knowing my mother’s dementia would lead to her eventual death. This got me reflecting on familial relationships.</p>\n<p>In a letter I wrote to our step-mother over Christmas, I likened our family to a diaspora of micro families that don’t frequently interact with each other, and when we do, it’s all through a veneer of casual, apathetic complacency. Happy enough with things to not be concerned about anything in particular. Pleasantries passed about like business cards.</p>\n<p>This is no way for a family to act, so I’ve decided that I’m going to reconnect with my sister and her family and our terminally acidic brother. And maybe even our estranged brother-in-law, our older sister’s widow. My sister has already agreed, which makes me endlessly happy, but I have yet to speak to either of my brothers. I believe they will be saltier to deal with, but I shall make the effort.</p>\n<p>I have lots of issues to deal with, personally, within my family, and among my distributed family, that I think it’s far better to at least work on positive communications with your family, despite the hard pasts. It’s so much better to work together as a team, leveraging our strengths and forgiving the weaknesses in ourselves and others, to achieve a goal. But it seems so very hard to muster the courage to work with some people. I’ll remind you of this, though:</p>\n<blockquote><em>We’ve all got our demons.</em></blockquote>\n<p>We could compare scars all day long, but in the end our pains our ours alone and we can neither share nor compare them with others. These burdens are ours to bear, but that doesn’t mean we can’t work together to share the load across many shoulders.</p>\n<p>It’s never an easy row to hoe, change. Think of the metaphor. Dirt. On the top, it’s old and crusty and drained of nutrients. Underneath, however, the sustenance-rich, moist, life-giving soil has been spending years growing on the food of the past, and is now getting churned into the crusty, old topsoil, blending the two into an amalgam of old and new, each fighting for prominence. The old, running out of resources, desperately clutching at authority for validation, to keep mattering.</p>\n<p>But they do matter. They need to move into teaching roles to feed the new soil being readied for the next tilling, and so on, and so forth… As each season fades into glorious reds and oranges before falling to the ground to feed the soil that feeds the tree that feeds so many, making room for the new leaves to stretch out and reach for the Sun.</p>\n<p>My father fought for that ideal in Apartheid South Africa alongside Bishop Desmond Tutu. He fought for the souls of human beings to be recognized as such, in a society where racial segregation and hatred had become indoctrinated into law. With the help of many others, my father did his part to bring about freedom in South Africa.</p>\n<p>You’d think that kind of deep human empathy would translate to a loving home life, but you’d be wrong. It wasn’t ripped from the pages of a horror anthology. It was my otherization because I was adopted. Likewise, it was dad focusing on my fuckups more than he focused on his blood children’s authentic issues.</p>\n<p>He wasn’t a dad as much as he was an event.</p>\n<p>But I’m not here to denigrate my father. I know that he loved us all, and we loved him. When I asked to go to Disneyland for my birthday every year, we went. I wasn’t abused, at least not in obvious ways. I was, however, sent off to boarding schools, anything to keep my away from home and out of anyone’s hair. At the age of nine, after truly learning that I was adopted from my mother, that growing sense of abandonment continued to swell inside me.</p>\n<p>The sense compounded after, upon evaluating my life at the nexus of my eighteenth birthday, I counted that I had been sent to no less than nine different schools since kindergarten. There’s no question I was a difficult child. I won’t apologize for that. Those were times past that I can no longer rectify directly. That work must be done retroactively.</p>\n<p>But it’s still hard knowing that, as a child, you had appointments to meet with your father in his office.</p>\n<p>There’s an emotional distancing to that. It sticks with me, that I dealt with dad’s secretary almost as much as I did him directly. But there’s something that hurts far more, and it didn’t have to happen this way. Choices were made, and we have to abide by them for now, but I make no guarantees that I won’t go after them in the near future. What is it that I’m talking about?</p>\n<p>That my step-mother wouldn’t let me see my father before he died.</p>\n<p>That, I’ll never forgive. Or forget.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, however, I think I’ll get to writing that which I should have been writing for a very long time.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",

[SOURCE: <a href=\"https://boredomtherapy.com/poor-and-rich-neighborhoods-side-by-side/\" target=\"_blank\">BoredomTherapy</a>]<p>There is an existing dynamic between capitalism and science which fosters a high stakes game of one-upmanship among different corporations and organizations to find the “killer app” and crush the competition. An enormous component of this dynamic is the winner-take-all mentality that is a core tenet of today’s current hyper-capitalism.</p>\n<p>Proponents of capitalism claim that it is the market that is the catalyst for the competition that has created all of our advanced technologies and drives our future. Without capitalists being allowed to do whatever they want (ala Ayn Rand) our potential will waste away as we languish in a socialist paradise overflowing with flotillas of content people, no longer interested in competing because there’s no hunger behind that drive to innovate.</p>\n<p>This concept causes the rise and fall of entire industries and consumes billions of dollars every single year, raising and dashing the hopes of hundreds of thousands of employees caught in this seemingly never-ending tide of feast or famine. In the meantime, the capitalists who started off as innovators have amassed vast oceans of wealth and owning, year after year, more and more of the artificially finite global cash reserve, while a growing number of people on Earth fall deeper into poverty as available money inexorably moves towards the top.</p>\n<p>This, we are told, is what we need because, without it we would all just be filthy apes scrabbling in the dirt for food. We should thank the “job creators” for fostering an environment where the struggle for little slips of paper is real and necessary and the only thing that will drag us out of our neanderthal state and into a glorious future full of bright, shiny technology and prosperity.</p>\n<p>On the face of it, that’s rather preposterous. Before money, people competed just fine. With money, people compete just fine. We live next to a baseball field and every Monday night anywhere from 20–40 people show up to play a night of baseball. Nobody pays them. It’s not a formalized league. There is no prize for winning. Yet, people still congregate to share in the sheer joy of competing with each other. You should hear the noise that rises from that field. Those people put their hearts and souls into those games, and for no reward greater than just having tried their best.</p>\n<p>What do you think? Can we have functional competition while maintaining a healthy lifestyle for everyone on Earth? If humans invented money, can’t we just invent a better way and still have all the benefits a global society, rich in cultural diversity brings?</p>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

It beat a staccato rhythm against the rails, countering the smooth, blur outside the double-pane window upon which I rested my right temple. The car swayed; gently, then roughly, and gently again. Several tons of steel, aluminum, plastic, wood, and fabric played a cacophonous symphony as it hurtled down the misty California coastline. I watched without seeing, my vision blurred as my mind juggled thoughts of indecision and mortality.</p>\n<p>“Is anyone sitting here,” said a voice over my left shoulder. I sat alone in a set of four seats arranged to face each other.</p>\n<p>“No,” I responded, leaving my head on the chilly glass.</p>\n<p>“Indeed,” said the voice.</p>\n<p>Santa Barbara was fading away behind me, but the little city couldn’t have remained clearer in the theater of my mind. The events of the last week were still fresh, an open wound of shock, resignation, and pent up emotion let loose in a resultant torrent of rage.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div><hr></div>\n<div><div>\n<p>I got the news Tuesday morning as I drove to work through Santa Ana. The traffic was worse than usual, an accident a few miles away having caused ripples of congestion to spread out like concentric wavelets on the surface of a pond.</p>\n<p>My father had been found dead in his Ojai home.</p>\n<p>The scuttlebutt was homicide, as if that were even possible. The idea was so absurd I couldn’t stop turning it over and over, examining every possible angle. I called work and told them I wasn’t coming in, that there was a sickness in the family, and I would be gone for, at least, a few days. My boss wished me and my family well, and I turned around to head North. You can, after all, go home again, but nothing will be the same.</p>\n<p>I guess that was the point.</p>\n<p>The trip up the coast was punctuated by whipping rain and tearing gusts pouring from dull, grey skies, feeling very much like my mood had been extracted and hoisted up for all to see. I rented a car in Santa Barbara and drove up to Ojai, checked in at a hotel, and made my way to the house. My father’s body had already been moved, and there was some kid in a police uniform minding the front door, trying to look authoritative.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div><hr></div>\n<div><div>\n<p>That… familiar voice came out of the fog.</p>\n<p>“A penny for your thoughts,” it said.</p>\n<p>“That’s my line,” I quipped, and looked around.</p>\n<p>That was the first time that turning my head would be an event unto itself. I stared across the gap between the seats to peer into eyes as pale blue as my own, but older, worn, beaten, but oddly content. The elderly man smiled at me; his left front incisor cocked at an odd angle. He stroked his sparse, closely cropped beard and chuckled.</p>\n<p>“Pay no mind to me. I just saw you so deep in thought you might want some help back up for some air,” he said in a comfortable baritone.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it’s nothing,” I lied. “I’m just thinking about something.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah.” He said. I sighed and turned to look at the endless shoreline passing by.</p>\n<p>“Rough times,” he said, almost too quietly to hear.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div><hr></div>\n<div><div>\n<p>I had just gotten out of the rental when an unmarked detective car rolled up to the curb. The doors popped open and two large men in neatly tidy suits climbed out, making the Crown Victoria look like a clown car. The passenger took two enormous, though oddly lazy, strides towards me and extended his hand.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Kerr.” It was a statement of fact.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” I replied.</p>\n<p>“I am sorry for your loss.” Another statement of fact.</p>\n<p>“Thank you,” I responded. I shook his hand or, to be accurate, he enveloped mine and then waggled it around.</p>\n<p>“Mr. Kerr,” stated the other man, “I’m Detective Hatch. This is Detective Stokes.” Hatch put his hand in his pocket and pulled out what looked like a Zippo lighter. It was his smart phone. A smirk crossed my face.</p>\n<p>“Your father was found at 5AM Tuesday morning. I was the one who called you. I can’t give you any details about the crime, but I can tell you that it was clear that he was killed,” announced Hatch. Stokes nodded in agreement, clutching his hands behind his back at what appeared to be parade rest.</p>\n<p>It didn’t really click into place. They were just words, spoken at me by a pair of monotonic yetis in dark suits. My mother had passed away four years prior of lung cancer. She was a prodigious smoker. My father had never smoked. He had been retired for more than a decade but had never stopped being a minister to his congregation.</p>\n<p>“Wow,” was all I could say.</p>\n</div></div>\n<div><hr></div>\n<div><div>\n<p>The train started to slow, its rhythm slowing in pace and insistence. We were stopping at Union Station in downtown LA where I would change over to a Metro train to take me back to Mission Viejo. The marine layer was thick, but it wasn’t raining. The man sitting across from me was looking across the car. I could see he was a little thinning, his hair a rumpled mess of brown and grey.</p>\n<p>“What did you mean,” I asked his neck. He slowly turned, that gentle, crooked smile on his lips.</p>\n<p>“By what,” he queried.</p>\n<p>“You said ‘rough times’ just now,” I reminded him.</p>\n<p>“Oh, that.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah.”</p>\n<p>“You had this look in your eyes that spoke of a deep pain,” he said, his gaze calm and friendly. He smiled a little less.</p>\n<p>“If only that weren’t true,” I said. I felt the anguish start to bubble in my gut and a flush come to my face.</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen some ugly things,” he said.</p>\n<p>I sat there, saying nothing. The train was moving into the yard. In a few minutes, everyone would be getting up to get off the train and find their happiness or sadness or nothing at all.</p>\n<p>“There was once a time in my life that I had no idea what to do. I had faced a terrible demon and fought it for years,” he said, almost wistfully.</p>\n<p>“What happened,” I asked.</p>\n<p>“I won.” The smile came back. I looked into those eyes and I saw that there was peace.</p>\n<p>The train came to a stop and dozens of people stood, fetching parcels and luggage from the overhead racks. I started to stand, but the man placed his hand on mine and leaned in.</p>\n<p>“I know you’ll win, too,” he said, winking.</p>\n<p>He stood, wheeled around, and followed the crowd out of the train car. After a few minutes, I stood up, wondering what just happened. I grabbed my bag, and swung down out of the train, sucking at the the little notch in my front tooth.</p>\n<p><em>Photo by </em><a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/@stefanstefancik?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Stefan Stefancik </em></a><em>from </em><a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/black-and-white-person-train-motion-42153/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Pexels</em></a></p>\n</div></div>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

In the case of Yahoo, it was 3 billion.</p>\n<p>That’s billion, with a capital “B”.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*aj-XErjOAOoDtsg4\" title=\"Image: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*aj-XErjOAOoDtsg4\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@matthewhenry?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Henry</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a><p>That’s a lot of people’s personal and, as in the case with Anthem Health, very confidential, data. In some cases it was just email addresses and passwords, some of which weren’t even encrypted. In others, complete packages of personally identifying data was taken. Many of these people are now targeted by scammers to steal from them or hold their data for ransom.</p>\n<p>I found this to be an unacceptable relationship, but I already had an out. I’ve been a proponent of Free and Open Source Software (often notated as FOSS) for a few decades now. Back when we had a converted garage office in New Mexico, I taught myself how to build out early versions of Caldera Linux into a workable desktop and used that for my writing work for two full years.</p>\n<p>But then, I’m a nerd.</p>\n<p>A few years ago, my wife <a href=\"https://rimaregas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rima</a> and I were chatting in Facebook Messenger about something we were interested in purchasing. Neither of us had searched for it or mentioned the product in any social networking service. Regardless, ads for the product started showing up on Facebook and various sites on the web. I’m sure you’ve had a similar experience, and out experience embittered me towards Messenger. I felt that there had to be something better from people who were acting for the benefit of human beings, not the bottom line.</p>\n<p>It was then that I started looking into alternatives that would offer my family the peace of mind that we had always desired, and I found <a href=\"https://telegram.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Telegram</a>. After some prodding, I got both my wife and daughter, as well as a handful of close friends, to open accounts, and we’ve been using it ever since. While my wife retained her Facebook account because of her sizable following, I closed my account, and haven’t found any interest in returning since.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*1XaSxIA92lNvlmMF\" title=\"Image: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*1XaSxIA92lNvlmMF\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*Wr1LqPaadmsS_GRn\" title=\"Image: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*Wr1LqPaadmsS_GRn\"><p>The number of data breaches in all sectors has been on the rise, almost since the inception of the public internet, and this will continue to be a real issue that will affect real people and cause real damage as long as capitalism is the sole player on the internet at large.</p>\n<h3>What you can do that’s not all that difficult</h3>\n<p>First, you can <strong>stop using Facebook and their related services, WhatsApp and Instagram</strong> and develop a strong sense of skepticism when you are offered something for free. After being burned by Facebook, I did just that. I went out and leveraged my tools to track down services that would allow my family to communicate securely, and carefully vetted them for the values I was seeking. I had even considered WhatsApp back then, not aware that Facebook had already, or was about to, acquire them.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*DOl5P7v-cUaOtD11\" title=\"Image: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*DOl5P7v-cUaOtD11\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@kylejglenn?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\">Kyle Glenn</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a><p>After an exhaustive amount of research, I signed up for an account on Telegram, and now I doubt I’d be able to get my wife and daughter to give it up, either. But, don’t take my word for it. Do your own research. Find out for yourself what circumstances would lead someone like Pavel Durov, the Co-Founder of Telegram, to say something like this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<em>Every one of us is going to die eventually, but we as a species will stick around for a while. That’s why I think accumulating money, fame or power is irrelevant. Serving humanity is the only thing that really matters in the long run. -Pavel Durov, Co-Founder of Telegram, 2019 [ </em><a href=\"https://telegra.ph/Why-WhatsApp-Will-Never-Be-Secure-05-15\" target=\"_blank\"><em>SOURCE</em></a><em>]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are a number of other things you can do to give yourself the best possible chance in this increasingly difficult world:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Switch to </strong><a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?redirect_source=firefox-com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Mozilla’s Firefox</strong></a><strong> for browsing</strong>. It’s fast and supports many of the same or similar extensions that Google’s app does, but doesn’t contain all of the invasive stuff that the browser from the Big G shoehorns into Chrome.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Use an ad-blocker and tracker blocker in combination</strong>, no matter how much some sites complain. I’d suggest <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/\" target=\"_blank\">uBlock Origin </a>and the <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/?src=search\" target=\"_blank\">Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Privacy Badger.</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stop using Google</strong>. Period. Their old slogan, “Don’t Be Evil,” died off a long time ago and their singular focus is now on dominating the internet with revenue-generating free services where they pump ads at you while selling your data to anyone with money.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>If you need an email service</strong>, check out <a href=\"https://protonmail.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ProtonMail</a> or Tutanota. These privacy-oriented services offer webmail and apps for iOS and Android. Tutanota is the more reasonable at only $13.41 a year for Premium (it’s a German company, so their rates are in Euros), but some people prefer ProtonMail (which is a Swiss company).</li>\n<li>If those seem too nerdy for you, use <a href=\"https://products.office.com/en-us/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?activetab=tab%3aprimaryr1\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft’s Outlook.com</a> service through Office 365. A personal account costs just $7 a month and includes the complete office suite for Windows AND MacOS and a ton of other features. Yes, I know a lot of people complain about Microsoft “spying” on everyone, but CEO Satya Nadella has been on a crusade to change the entire culture of the largest operating system maker in the world, including a deep embrace of FOSS technologies and an ethic that will challenge the status quo over privacy in the coming years. I’ve been using the service for years now and not once have I ever seen private communications used to push ads at me. NOTE: The free version does display ads, but you can turn off personalization.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stop using stupid passwords</strong>. Get <a href=\"https://lastpass.com/\" target=\"_blank\">LastPass</a> or <a href=\"https://keepass.info/\" target=\"_blank\">KeePass</a> and use it to not only store your credentials, but also generate unique ones for each service you use. Sure, LastPass is a division of LogMeIn, but it’s inexpensive (at $24 a year) and has a good track record for security. KeePass, on the other hand, is FOSS and requires some additional nerding, but is well worth it, if you’re technically minded.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stop using SMS</strong>. It’s stupid old, is slow, has loads of limitations, and some carriers still charge per message. For chat with your friends and family, use <a href=\"https://telegram.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Telegram</a> or <a href=\"https://about.riot.im/\" target=\"_blank\">Riot.im</a>. Telegram is fully integrated on all common platforms and supports a wide range of features, many of which WhatsApp copies (and not very well, I might add). Riot.im is what’s called a federated networking system that connects privately run servers in a loose network to form a large-scale social chat system. It’s a touch more fiddly than Telegram, but it has a lot of fantastic features you can’t find anywhere else.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Learn about the world of FOSS</strong>. It’s a diverse, engaging, and surprisingly complete world where millions of people live and work and play without being subjected to the whims of irresponsible corporations who are only driven by profit at any cost. Check out sites like <a href=\"https://itsfoss.com/\" target=\"_blank\">It’s FOSS </a>or, if you are a programmer for Windows or Mac and would like to dig into FOSS, check out <a href=\"https://opensource.guide/\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub’s OpenSource.Guide</a>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stop selling yourself</strong>. You’re worth more than $12 a year, which is what companies like Facebook and Google make off each user through ad views. It’s critical to their bottom line that they hook as many eyes as possible to make as much money as possible, and values aren’t really a consideration. You are priceless, and you need to use tools and services that don’t treat you like a piece of meat that pulls in a few pennies a day. You. Are. Priceless. Treat yourself that way.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why should I pay for something I can get free?</h3>\n<p>The simple answer is to shift the balance of power back to the consumer. Right now, you give away your personal data, where you go, what you search for, what you buy, what you write and delete, which sites you go to, how you relate to other people, and much, much more in exchange for seeing advertisements.</p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*4k_bu425E2JhwzSm\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@samanthasophia?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\">Samantha Sophia</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a><p>Your data earns companies like Facebook money, as does the ad revenue. All of this free data people willingly give up dis-incentivizes them from offering real customer value and support, from fixing security flaws, and generally being good corporate citizens. The same applies to Google and others. Since Facebook has a few BILLION users, they don’t really give a damn about how it hurts anyone or risks the privacy and security of individuals. It’s not, after all, their problem.</p>\n<p>The best way to fight this is to remove from these companies the source of their revenues, i.e., leaving their services and paying moderate fees and making donations to projects that do NOT sell your data and that do NOT earn revenue from advertising*. This generally means switching to some kind of open source-based projects, like the newly created project from <a href=\"https://puri.sm/\" target=\"_blank\">Purism</a> called <a href=\"https://librem.one/\" target=\"_blank\">Librem.one</a>.</p>\n<p>*some advertising isn’t bad, such as advertising on a news site, but it shouldn’t be targeted and it shouldn’t rely on spying on you to figure out what you want. A good advertiser will do the hard work to reach out to their target markets.</p>\n<p>Librem.one is a set of services, using a range of open source projects, that are designed to replace things like Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Gmail, and Google Drive, among many more which are planned. We pay for this service in lieu of having our data scraped and ads blasted at us. The more of us who speak with our money and our choices, the more these services can develop into better, more accessible tools that help us through our daily lives.</p>\n<p>All I ask if that you reevaluate what it is that you get from the internet and how those choices are affecting you and those around you, and choose to take a different approach that might actually benefit everyone instead of just people like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, or the Google machine.</p>\n</div></div>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>The following essay is from a Quora comment that I made in response to this honest question:</p>\n<p><i>But I still think it is strange \nwhat has happened to the USA. It used to be the country that got \ntogether to solve any kind of problem or public need. You had the entire\n country to have paved roads and everybody had cars way ahead of us even\n so with electricity and telephones. You invented the Internet. But now \nit looks like every community expects somebody else “big corporations” \nto come and sort all problems out. What changed so that the US stopped \nto be a “let us get together and solve this shit!”. I am by no means \ncomplaining to you I just don't get it. It is like the public is afraid \nof starting or wanting changes. - Kjell (2019)<br></i></p>\n<p><i>---<br></i></p>\n<p>There are a lot of Americans who feel the same way, Kjell. It’s not wrong that you’re confused.</p>\n<p>The problems stems mostly from capitalism, principally the form as espoused by Milton Friedman. Milton said a few things that I hope will give you an idea of what’s been happening for decades: </p>\n<p>“The problem of social organization is how to set up an arrangement under which greed will do the least harm, capitalism is that kind of a system.”</p>\n<p>and…</p>\n<p>“The world runs on individuals pursuing their self interests. The great achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus. Einstein didn't construct his theory under order from a bureaucrat. Henry Ford didn't revolutionize the automobile industry that way.”</p>\n<p>and…</p>\n<p>“When government - in pursuit of good intentions - tries to rearrange the economy, legislate morality, or help special interests, the cost come in inefficiency, lack of motivation, and loss of freedom. Government should be a referee, not an active player.”</p>\n<p>It’s not all on Milton’s head, though. A lot of where we are now is the tacit agreement between various groups seeking power and control and freedom from government limitations, such as the Religious Right, the Koch brother(s), the white supremacist Alt-Right, protectionists, Libertarians, conservative Republicans, and others who were tired of losing their individual fights. </p>\n<p>Obama really put a bee in their bonnet, which gave the Tea Party, the Koch’s pet project, a target to rage against, and pushed the GOP into forming a policy that would try to make Obama a one-term President. </p>\n<p>They failed to make that goal, but they were deeply successful at obstruction and fear mongering. Leveraging tools like propaganda, a unified messaging scheme, the use of lower-level sacrificial lambs to test the waters for said messaging (how low can they go before things break), spreading false narratives, and engaging the services of networks like Fox News whose leadership were keen to have America run by people who were far more empathetic to their goals. </p>\n<p>It is around this time that Trump pops up with his claims that Obama wasn’t a real American, but an imposter from Kenya. Other lies that were spread around were that Democrats wanted to take away everyone’s guns, and that national health care would necessitate the need for Death Panels to decide who would get health care. </p>\n<p>The reality, however, wasn’t about the issues that were all over the news cycle day in and day out, but the Right’s new agenda package. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower taxes for the wealthy</li>\n<li>Reduce, if not eliminate, regulations on business</li>\n<li>Get rid of illegal immigrants</li>\n<li>Eradicate religious diversification </li>\n<li>Legitimize the re-segregation of America</li>\n<li>Empower a renewed need for male dominance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Trump gave the ‘cabal’ two things. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>A target that media would focus on and a mouthpiece that sat at one of the biggest tables on the world stage in a single person</li>\n<li>An in to start changing the American government that would facilitate their desire to ‘terraform’ the country in the form of a Republican party that was reshaped by the Tea Party</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By the end of the 2016 election, enough American were disgusted by the choices on offer to not vote enough for Hillary Clinton, and Trump was able to win, despite being dramatically short of the popular vote. Not that it mattered, since Americans don’t vote for presidents. The Electorate does, and all they need is enough incentive to pick the candidate that can muster enough support. </p>\n<p>States Rights also played a significant role, by allowing each state to organize their own election rules, which means each state gets to select how the candidates will receive their electoral college votes. </p>\n<p>This has never been about making America great again, but taking America back from the dirty, unwashed, uncouth and colored filth that come to bright, shining America to build a better life for their families. </p>\n<p>Its about getting revenge for losing their slave labor, having to see all those Black people walking around free, making money, and being happy instead of earning the white people money with their blood, sweat, and lives because they are less than human. Cows don’t run Fortune 500 companies, do they? </p>\n<p>Its about getting people out of their face when they want to poison a lake to make 100,000 more widgets an hour and not having to pay a lot for labor.</p>\n<p>Its about getting those fat stacks of cash, and fuck anyone who isn’t devious enough to get it first. </p>\n<p>Its about winning. </p>\n<p>And the only way to win this game, the game that involves the lives of 300,000,000+ human beings, is to play dirty, no matter who it hurts, as long as someone comes out on top. </p>\n<p>And that, my friend, will get us a planet devoid of intelligent life.</p>\n<p>Strap in. It’s going to be a bumpy ride. </p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>Western societal ideals have always been broken when it comes to animated content. First, there is the core element that states when you are no longer a child you leave childish things behind and grow up. Adults aren't supposed to like the same things when they were children. Kids drink juice boxes. Adults drink coffee. Kids watch cartoons. Adults watch TV dramas. It's not okay to retain your childhood because that means you aren't responsible. This infects the entire scope of western animation production because it is a core principle that we perpetuate. If you liked Toy Story when you were a kid, it's only valid to look back on it with nostalgia as an adult or share it with your kids. Watching it alone, however, is deviant. Cartoons, after all, are for kids. </p>\n<p>Adult animation is an alien concept to much of Western Society.</p>\n<p>Of course, that all ignores the reality that is the human animal. First, and most critical, we are not static samples of a human being. We shift and change and grow, but a lot gets locked in by 30. That's not to say we don't add new likes and dislikes, but the range of categories/genre/ideas we accept are generally solidified. As an example, I'm turning 50 on the 14th. I play video games and watch loads of animated content. I've been doing those things since I was a kid and nobody told me to stop doing that and grow up. Do I play the same games and watch the same things I did when I was 10? Of course not. My tastes in animation have grown to seek out the beauty of traditional animation and more complex storytelling. <br></p>\n<div>\n<p>Now, watch this...</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFtbYqjcM2c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>If you can't tell, Doki Doki Literature Club, or DDLC, is a dating sim style game. This is a common form of game in Japanese society, where 13 is the age you are considered old enough to take on real responsibilities by yourself. This idea pervades Japanese media and storytelling, where young protagonists feature everywhere. </p>\n<p>But, I digress...</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>DDLC is a dating sim where you play as a character and interact with other characters. Yet, DDLC is also not like other dating sims because it subverts that genre by introducing psychological horror. The makers of the game clearly state that this is what they are doing and aren't trying to fool anyone. The concept behind the game is the experience, not a Sixth Sense grade twist. When I started playing it, I was already filled with a sense of dread because I was caught up in looking for signs that my mind was getting screwed with. That's one hell of a trick to play on a gamer, and it's effective. </p>\n<p>But it is also not a game for kids, and the definition of kid in Japan is 12 and under, so the makers of the game clearly state that this game is for people 13 years of age and older. Period. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>That's because the adults are expected to actually parent their children, teach them right from wrong, teach them real from fantasy, teach them how to learn, and foster their growth as individuals. Not only that, but 13 makes a great delineation for adulthood because that's when puberty happens and we become physiological adults, too. Around 13 is when everything changes, and there's nothing stopping it, so many societies say \"why bother\" and prepare their kids for the inevitable adulthood that comes whether they like it or not. </p>\n<p>We look at it differently. Because of our puritanical roots, we don't like what puberty brings, so we construct arbitrary boundaries for adulthood, like the age of 18. It's no surprise that most developed societies apply age limits to a range of things like driving and smoking and drinking and buying guns, but these are things we use and do, they aren't what adulthood is all about. We don't turn 21 to drink beer legally. We turn 21 because that's going to happen no matter what, and having 15 year olds running around drunk driving and smoking while shooting guns out the window seems like a terrible idea. </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>But applying that arbitrary delimiter to a biological eventuality is just crazy. It only make sense to plan in advance for said eventuality. Treating puberty as if it can be delayed simply adds several layers of complexity to the process of growing up, and that brings the potential for divergence from a neurologically stable place. This is, I propose, one of the key reasons why so many kids get in trouble for fooling around, getting caught drinking illegally, delve into drug use, and many other things westerners see as the problems they are trying to solve with the aforementioned limits. </p>\n<p>You go through puberty at 13, but  you can't do anything with it until your 18. That should go well.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>But, I digress.... again...</p>\n<p>The point I am trying to make is two-fold: </p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>There are lots of reasons for anything and no single thing can ever fix another without causing issues elsewhere. <br>\n</li>\n<li>Video games don't make kids psychotic. Chance does. <br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can't blame video games for your kid committing suicide just as the world can't directly blame the parents of the suicidal kid for following through. It is, however, important to note that these two factors are not on the same scale. The video game is a static, external object. The parents, on the other hand, interact with their child daily (I would hope) and their choices go much further in influencing their child's choices and actions, but they didn't murder their child. At the very least, they could be held responsible for not noticing the signs of depression that lead to suicide attempts. <br></p>\n<p>We don't know the recipe of life that leads to suicide in kids, but we do know some of them. Bullying, sexual/physical/verbal/psychological abuse, neglect and abandonment are all serious issues young people face, and how they deal with them depends almost entirely on the foundational development they receive from their parent/parents, friends and family, and other caregivers/educators. If there are too many holes in a kids support net, there is more and more room for bad ideas to pervade. <br></p>\n<p>But even those numerous elements aren't the root/root/root cause. What it really comes down to is the fault of nobody; genetics and environment. Abuse is, without minimizing it, just the operational component. There must also be a structural component upon which the operational crap builds on. It's the same random chance generator that life is that produces kids with Autism or Down's Syndrome or Bipolarity or developmental issues. Psychoses are not, as a rule, created out of whole cloth by a few random interactions. They come from a complex, interwoven, impossibly entangled set of physiological and psychological factors that we just don't understand. <br></p>\n<p>If we all just mimicked what we see in video games, we'd all be dead and the Earth would be a smoking husk. So, clearly, it isn't the fault of video games, and cute stuff isn't specifically marketed to kids, just as vaping juice that tastes like breakfast cereal isn't designed to attract kids. We like the things we like, and some of those things are the same things we liked when we were 9. It's not rocket science. Do you still pick your nose? Did you stop automatically when you turned 18? I do, at least until I found out that I wasn't taking care of my nose properly, and ever since I started using a Neti pot, I don't have to pick any more because I don't produce boogers any more. <br></p>\n<p>Yes, it's gross, but it illustrates my point rather tidily. <br></p>\n<p>So, some of the takeaways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Animation isn't an art form strictly limited to juvenile fare. It's just a visual storytelling medium. <br>\n</li>\n<li>Video games do not create people. People make people. Therefore, video games do not create psychoses. <br>\n</li>\n<li>Leaving bullying and all forms of abuse uncorrected creates an enormous hole into which people can fall. <br>\n</li>\n<li>A strong support net that educates kids without coddling them is critical to the development of a well-rounded person.</li>\n<li>We don't learn by being shielded from everything. <br>\n</li>\n<li>Biology cannot be stopped. <br>\n</li>\n<li>The cause of a behavior is almost never the most obvious thing. <br>\n</li>\n<li>Society can change to make things better, but we must be willing to make those changes, no matter how hard. <br>\n</li>\n<li>I'm a huge nerd.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>So, that's that. Thanks for reading. <br>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

				"title": "The Single Worst Job I've Ever Had",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p><i>NOTE: I started writing this earlier this year when I was fired from my first new job in four years after four months. I just got the to the point where I didn't care to tell the tale any more, but now, some months later and more depressed than ever, I wanted to post what I'd written, just to get it out there. I'm no angel. I'm nowhere near perfect. I make mistakes and sometimes I've been fired because it was the right thing to do, but not this time. This is simply a matter of a rich asshole who thinks he's all that and a bag of chips can treat people like shit and it will never touch him. Something similar happened in France a while ago. That didn't end well. -TCR</i><br></p>\n<p>On July 14th of this year, I will turn 50. That's quite the milestone for anyone. I never felt that I wouldn't make it to the half Century mark, but it feels somewhat surreal now that I'm here. One thing that being 50 doesn't often involve, however, is the level of humiliation I was forced to undergo with a recent employer. Out of a sense of honor, I won't reveal any identifying details, but I feel it is necessary for me to get this out of my system. First, though, some context...</p>\n<p>I've been writing professionally for about 20 years now. The breakdown is simple; over 100 books as technical editor or revisor. One book as the author. Two more as co-author. Since contract writing is all about the ebb and flow, I also consulted, personally and for other consultancies. I wrote documentation for myself and the small businesses I worked with. After the computer book publishing world dried up for tenured authors like myself, I went into corporate work where I did high-level consulting and traditional employment. I wrote documentation for all of those companies. In short, I'd say I have experience.</p>\n<p>2008 was a bad year for me, though. When contracts started dropping like flies from one consultancy I was working for, I was laid off along with half of the staff. I worked a number of contract jobs for a couple of years for a sizable discount. Money was \"tight\", apparently. The Recession illustrated to corporate types they could bring in the same revenue with fewer employees when those remaining felt the constant fear of being made redundant. HR departments also decided that work experience was shit and everyone needed an advanced degree to jobs cleaning toilets. Since I never received a degree, as I am not a traditional learner, I was left out in the cold. My advancing age and experience didn't help, either. <br></p>\n<p>To summarize, I did end up getting a real job in 2011, which lasted about 9 months. The new drought brought me to 2013 where I got a promising contracting gig, but corporate politics well over my head nixed that. I would have to wait until just after the New Year of 2018 to even be offered something, so I took it. <br></p>\n<p>Just four short months later, that would turn out to be a costly mistake. <br></p>\n<p>So, the overview is easy. Small company. They've been in business for seven years, develop an application, and sell it to a tight, vertical market. Since it works on top of existing systems to add features that don't exist in the core market players, it's not really competition. The company charges a not-insignificant monthly fee for these small businesses to use their software. I was hired to perform a job and that job was to fix their documentation, both internally and for the customers. <br></p>\n<p>I can say, in all honesty, that after four years of unemployment and two and a half years of rideshare driving, I was both elated and rusty. I worked with it, anyway. I was honest with them in my interview, and was told that I was hired, in part, because of that honesty. I'm old, have too much experience, and don't have a degree. I also have sleep apnea (treated with a CPAP) and mild narcolepsy, so I doze off during the day at times, usually when I'm not engaged in a conversation. I didn't hide anything (well, maybe a few things, but none of that shit's their business.) <br></p>\n<p>I migrated nearly 300 articles from their old knowledge base system to the new one. Manually. With my colleague, I developed a half dozen methodologies for updating, modifying, extending, and simplifying the documentation, all of which were shot down. I found a friend in my colleague, as we shared frustration over the casual dismissal of what would be landmark improvements to the company. I was even asked to research and provide information for Single Source documentation systems, which I did, and was told weeks later that we weren't going to do such a ridiculously logical thing. <br></p>\n<p>Wow. <br></p>\n<p>I marshalled on, weathering the weirdness and coming to accept that the smart thing was just not going to happen. We weren't in charge. We didn't have the money. We weren't rich. We were peons. Then some things started to change. I was brought into meetings to go over new features that I was expected to document. Nothing weird there. I dutifully took notes, asked questions, and did my best to add these projects to my plate. I inquired about priority, but was never given a straight answer, so I did my best, assuming that these new projects would take precendence. It's sometimes necessary to assume when your direct queries don't result in clear answers. <br></p>\n<p>One of these projects turned out to be rather dear to the owner. I figured that since the owner was the lead (and sole) programmer and kept the entire thing in his head (and some random folders on his machine) that the entire thing was dear to him. Boy, was I mistaken. This one project caused a lot of problems. It wasn't a complex thing. In fact, it was rather straightforward, but the owner had his own way to describing it, and I didn't pick up any hints that, regardless of all the work I had done to normalize documentation and apply a standardized style guide, I was expected to deliver documentation in an obnoxiously specific way. <br></p>\n<p>I was expected to write like the owner. <br></p>\n<p>Needless to say, the owner doesn't speak anything but Programmatic Nerdish. Combine this with the fact that English isn't his first language and you get what would appear to be a surmountable oddity. Surely, without much convincing, the owner would recognize the need to have consistency in documentation and angle the content neatly towards the customers, right? I can hear the choruses of \"No\" in your head, and you'd be correct. <br></p>\n<p>First draft was returned with notes. <br></p>\n<p>Second draft was returned, but without notes. <br></p>\n<p>Another meeting to go over the software again, By this time, it had all changed, a bad habit the owner had. I didn't take notes because he just had a few points, one of which just happened to be that \"I made stuff up.\"</p>\n<p>Yes. In essence, he called me a liar. <br></p>\n<p>Now, this beggars belief, because there isn't one place I've worked on the documentation where I was called a liar because I didn't quite understand something. One thing that writers do with non-fiction work is to interpret the information and make it lean toward the expected audience. That's why we draft work and vet it with Subject Matter Experts (SME). I've done this so many times with so many people, I can't even guess at how many. Hundreds. Thousands. I get the notes back and make the requested changes. <br></p>\n<p>Nope. I was effectively called a liar and was given a Word document that was written by the owner which I would insert into my document to \"make it better\". I was also told that I could edit the English, which made sense because the owner wasn't a writer and didn't learn English as a child. <br></p>\n<p><i>Here's where I stopped writing and never came back to it. Long story short, and I realize that's too little too late, I started cleaning up some extraneous stuff from my computer, so they locked me out. At the time, I didn't connect the two things, so it looked like they fired me. The never came to talk to me, so I just walked out. Fuck 'em. They're inept imbeciles anyway. Being able to program doesn't make anyone a genius, the same way that knowing more than one language doesn't make you a genius. (Much like the structure of that sentence doesn't make ME a genius!)</i></p>\n<p><i>So, that's it. The guys with way too much money and far too little sense get to keep what they have, and I lose nearly everything. Again. To an old guy who buys porsche on a whim and a kid who thinks his M-B C63 is just a \"regular\" car, I won't beg. I won't demean myself because you think that's your right as my employer. I won't and I didn't. <br></i></p>\n<p><i>I realize, too, that this is a bit of a disjointed narrative. It's been a few months now since this all happened, and I just no longer have enough fucks to give. <br></i></p>\n<p><i>If I manage to make my family moderately comfortable, I will have achieved a personal victory, but I won't do that at the expense of my values or someone elses right to exist in a dignified manner. <br></i></p>\n<p><i>I am a human being, Alec. You may have more money, but that just makes you richer, not superior. </i><br></p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p><i>I'm just going to write something directly out of my head, so we'll see how it goes. -TCR</i></p>\n<p>I've always liked the name Larry. It feels old without being stuffy, and there's an inherent jocularity about it. When you hear that you'll be meeting with some dude named Larry it instills in you the idea that the interaction won't be dark or heavy. When I walked into the room to meet my particular Larry, however, things didn't go as expected. <br></p>\n<p>My Larry was a woman and anything but jovial. <br></p>\n<p>\"Sit,\" she said, not looking up from her tablet. I sat.</p>\n<p>\"Thanks for agreeing to meet with me,\" I said as I settled into the uncomfortable straight-back chair. I noted that her chair was a large, stuffed leather affair, but pushed away the envy. Without looking up, she extended her index finger in the international sign for \"shut up and wait\". A few moments passed and she placed the tablet on the table and looked across the table into my eyes. <br></p>\n<p>\"So, how long have you known Rodrigo,\" she asked, not blinking. <br></p>\n<p>\"At last fifteen years, I think. We've been good frien...\" <br></p>\n<p>\"Just answer my questions,\" she interrupted. I sat there stunned. <i></i></p>\n<p><i>\"Just who is this Larry woman and why didn't Rod tell me about her,\" I thought to myself.</i></p>\n<p>I shook my head clear and responded, \"Fifteen years.\"</p>\n<p>\"Do you now or have you ever worked for the LAPD, any of its affiliates, suppliers, or any law enforcement agency, or any organization that has a contract with the LAPD?\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\"</p>\n<p>\"Have you ever held a position in any political party organization, been elected to any seat, or appointed to any role by a government official, either within the State of California or with the Federal Government?\"</p>\n<p>\"No.\" <br></p>\n<p>\"Have you ever been incarcerated? Have you ever been arrested? Are you parents still alive? Are you familiar with game theory? Do you drink liquor? Do you sleep on your side, back, or stomach?\"</p>\n<p>\"No. No. My mother. Moderately. A few times a week. Stomach.\"<br></p>\n<p>\"What, then, do you do?\"</p>\n<p>\"I am an industrial robot repair technician, first class.\"</p>\n<p>\"Will you consent to a background check?\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course,\" I said, sensing some positive flow to this brief and weird meeting for once. <br></p>\n<p>She leaned deeper into the leather padded chair and stared at me. I'm pretty sure she hadn't blinked once, but she might have blinked when I did. The odds of that happening must be astronomical. </p>\n<p>She reached out with her hand, curled her fingers into a fist, and rapped hard on the table three times, the sharp sound ringing loudly in the mostly empty room with no wall decorations. The door opened immediately and an old man walked in. <br></p>\n<p>\"There will be no need for the background check. I already ran one,\" She said to me. To the man she said, \"Take Mr. Chalmers to HR and have him fill out the paperwork.\" The old man bowed deeply, backed out of the room and waited in the hallway. Surprised at how quickly the situation had pivoted, I just sat there agape. <br></p>\n<p>\"He'll be joining us as head of MOBot development starting today,\" she said to me with those unblinking eyes, and smiled. <br></p>\n<p>I never wanted to see that smile again.<br></p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>So, next on the pervert docket we have legendary serious news journalist Charlie Rose...</p>\n<p>Wait, what?</p>\n<p>So, let's take the list of people called out for being predatory assholes so far: Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, John Besh (supposedly famous chef), Louis C.K., Hadrian Belove and Shadie Einashai (rich assholes with movie theaters), Richard Dreyfuss, Gary Goddard, Andy Henry, Dustin Hoffman, Robert Knepper, Andrew Kreisberg, Jeremy Piven, Brett Ratner, Steven Segal, Tom Sizemore, Jeffrey Tambor, James Toback, Senator Al Franken, and now Charlie Rose. But wait, there's more! Yeah. I mean there's a longer list, but I'm not going to type out any more names. If you want to see the mostly complete list, <a href=\"http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/2017/11/20/harvey-weinstein-impact-men-accused-sexual-misconduct/107790918/\" target=\"_blank\">look here</a>. </p>\n<p>So, I let this sit for a day, and what do we have now? John Lasseter. Yes, the John Lasseter that was key in evolving Pixar into the animated feature film studio it became. The John Lasseter that took over Disney Animation in 2006 and paved the way to enormous hits like Frozen, Wreck It Ralph, Inside Out, and the upcoming Coco. The John Lasseter who was instrumental in working with Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki to bring English-language releases of their beloved animated films to the West, movies like Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, My Neighbor Totoro, and Ponyo. <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-lasseters-pattern-alleged-misconduct-detailed-by-disney-pixar-insiders-1059594\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-lasseters-pattern-alleged-misconduct-detailed-by-disney-pixar-insiders-1059594\">The John Lasseter who apparently has a maneuver named after him where women angle to keep him from touching their legs</a>. </p>\n<p>Most men on these lists are pigs. It's easy to see. Weinstein is obnoxious. Spacey is outspoken and overconfident. Louis CK is brash and loud. Jeremy Piven seems to play himself in Entourage. Tom Sizemore has a history of violence against women. Steven Segal is a self-important asshole. But then there are the people whom we've come to trust. Al Franken. Charlie Rose. Now John Lasseter. </p>\n<p>So, what's going on? </p>\n<p>The simplest answer is that we are finally seeing the intersection of women's rights, sexual repression advocacy, and destructive male empowerment ideologies, though that's far from a simple answer. Women are human and, therefore, have human rights. Women must be afforded the same respect and dignity that men demand. Women are not animals or property. To treat women (and I also mean girls, in case you're looking for a loophole) as livestock or store products is wrong. So, stop it. </p>\n<p>Sexual repression has been going on for ages, ever since the first person was embarrassed to see people having sex right in front of them and they weren't getting any. Various forms of religion have long advocated control through abstinence. Religion works best as a method of human cattle management because it focuses on the core aspects of being human (i.e., sex, behavior, food, etc) and engages emotional touchstones (i.e., fear, joy, desire to belong, love). </p>\n<p>Then, last but far from least, we have what most people would call Rape Culture, but is deeply rooted in male empowerment, masculinity development, and patriarchy. Men are the top. Men are bosses. Men can do stuff that weak women can't do. Women are good for making lunch and babies and looking pretty and shutting up and that's it. Men are smarter, faster, stronger, large and in charge. Men aren't crybabies, need their mommies, or have doubts or fears, and if you have any of those needs, you're a sissy and need to man up or go die in a dark alley somewhere. </p>\n<p>How could that kind of hyperbolic assholery ever go wrong!</p>\n<p>Well, here's an example:</p>\n<p>        </p>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/151098/2024/poster.png\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" alt=\"\">\n<p>So, \"rape\" used to mean something, yes? Now it just means women dissatisfied with the sex they had with potent and skilled men? Invite some girls to your frat party, get them so drunk they can hardly stand, take them upstairs, and give them what should be the time of their life, and you're shocked when they get mad? Hell, they consented to getting drunk, right? They have women bodies that I can see with my man eyeballs, right? How is that rape? </p>\n<p>With women running around like they own the place, religious policies that have quashed the normal human sex drive creating people who have a pathological understanding of what sex actually is, combined with men who have been taught that they must take what they want and all things are subservient to them, is a combination that is just primed for a tipping point, and it seems that we might have reached it. Like gay marriage or unlike gun control.</p>\n<p>What we need is a healthy understanding of what human sexuality really is and that has to be taught in school, to all kids. Repression and extreme control methods need to be canned. Kids who are free and encouraged to experiment will come to understand it better, earlier, and develop a core sense of responsibility regarding sex. Our current ideals regarding sex, drugs and alcohol, work, and responsibiliity are skewed badly in ways that do not favor the development of kids who understand what life is really like, and that's one of the things that is holding us back, causing all manner of problems, and won't get better unless we really work for change. </p>\n<p>Humans have evolved over millions of years and sex becomes viable with the onset of puberty. To deny this simple, biological fact, as we have for all of recorded history, is to try to push back against the impossible weight of millions of years of evolution. </p>\n<p>That kind of strategy just can't win.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p><i>In this series, Amateur Egghead, I examine a range of different subjects on which I have no formal education or expertise of any kind. The opinions and thoughts within are my own and will likely piss a bunch of people off, mostly the ones who benefit from the things I talk about. -Ed.<br></i></p>\n<p>It's difficult to start this without getting directly to the point; why is psychology still a science when the only thing we're learning about the human mind is all about the mechanics of the brain? The brain is the medium in which the \"mind\" resides, but it is not the mind itself without the person attached to it and the experiences that person has had. Science, as defined by Oxford, is:</p>\n<blockquote><p><i>\"the intellectual and practical activity \nencompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the \nphysical and natural world through observation and experiment...\"</i></p></blockquote>\n<p>The world, as we know it, is already astonishingly complex, so much so that we don't know more than a fraction of what constitutes knowledge, and we've been hammering away at this ever since we became sentient. Hell, we don't even really know when that happened (though there are some really good guesses out there). Our universe, that which we can perceive and surmise from observation, is immensely enormous and, from our perspective, has no end. How do we even fathom that concept? </p>There's a bit in Douglas Adams' wonderful Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy trilogy where protagonist Arthur Dent ends up in a cave on Frogstar World B. There he meets Gargravarr, the custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex, a device so hideous that it can destroy your mind.<blockquote>\n<i>When you are put into the Vortex you are given just one momentary \nglimpse of the entire unimaginable infinity of creation, and somewhere \nin it there's a tiny little speck, a microscopic dot on a microscopic \ndot, which says, \"You are here.\"</i><br>\n</blockquote>The device works by extrapolating the existence of everything by scanning a piece of fairy cake (smaller cupcakes made by Brits using sponge cake). Even fictionalizing the entirety of the cosmos as a way of getting back at your nagging wife who complains that you lack perspective is just too big to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok\" target=\"_blank\">grok</a> (and I use this term on purpose, as you'll see if you click the link). Existence itself is simply too vast to completely understand beyond our less-than-subatomic little sphere of influence, perched on a tiny speck, floating in a dust cloud billions of times our size, which in turn is a speck that is one trillionth of another larger dust cloud. <br><br>It's no wonder people believe in gods. <br><br>Even on Earth, life is extraordinarily complex without even discussing the human factor. There are countless billions of all manner of life above and below the water. We discover new species almost every year. This planet, this tiny ball of rock and lava spinning in space, is literally teeming with life. Then there's us. Humans. People. <br><br>We, unlike any other species, have evolved the most, at least within terms we can understand (or grok, if you desire a deeper meaning). We alone have progressed beyond the mere simple acts of survival that differently evolved forms of life engage in. Thanks to our opposable thumbs, soft skin, and lack of significant offensive or defensive qualities, we came to develop a range of cognitive defenses that have proven formidable, especially when used against our own kind. Over millions of years and through several different iterations, we became sentient.<br><br>Once that happened, all hell broke loose. As soon as people started to understand that they were a \"they\", we began to develop everything we are today. We look at things and make decisions about them based on prior experience, whether that be where we were born and raised, who are parents were, who are friends were, the good and bad things that happened to us, education, food, sex, trauma, pain, love, everything. All of these have a basis in instinctual behaviors, but are mostly, significantly shaped by our experiences in life. We barely understand our place on Earth, much less in our galaxy in the even more incomprehensibly immense universe, to the point where we still believe in myths like Santa Claus and gods. <div><br></div>\n<div>So, please excuse me if I'm more than a little skeptical about people who call themselves scientists walking around telling others they can help them with their psychological issues if they just submit to years of costly psychotherapy. Is that snake oil I smell or are you blatantly bullshitting me? </div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>There is no question that there is real science being performed around a wide range of brain and mind related subjects. We're actually getting rather good with some of the mechanics of how the human mind works, but psychologists would have us believe that, with sufficient training, they can help people sort out the bits that you can't see or poke with a stick. My skepticism might have something to do with the fact that I, myself, was in therapy for well over a decade and find myself little different as a person for it. And yet, it's not personal. I never felt any ill will towards my therapists. In fact, most of them I liked quite a bit and one of them I can count as a friend, but they didn't help me, and that, I believe, is for a very specific reason. </div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>They don't <i>know</i> me. </div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>How could they? In order to effectively know someone, you must have shared their experiences. How can a person who has not been raped ever relate to someone who has undergone that horrifying experience? What could any therapist ever do to know what <a href=\"http://jacksonville.com/news/crime/2014-10-01/story/it-nothing-kill-cat-jacksonville-teen-tortured-killed-6-cats-planned\" target=\"_blank\">an individual who has a history of torturing cats to death</a> is going on inside their mind? How could the person sitting across from me ever understand what it was like to attend nine different schools before graduating and spending years on Ritalin for ADD and hyperactivty? I'd have to talk to a trained therapist who had ADHD, took badly misdosed Ritalin, was raised in an Episcopalean household (I'm a PK), experienced his parents divorce at the age of five, and learned he was adopted, not to mention the nine schools, many of which were private boarding schools. </div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Without direct experience, we can be empathetic if we are so inclined, but we can't relate in any meaningful way. I understand the urge in some to help others, and it does help to talk to someone without being judged, but it doesn't take years of intense study, a Master's degree, and an enormous, international organization to offer a kind, non-judgemental ear to someone in need. In fact, in American society, there's quite the stigma that goes along with getting therapy for mental health, so I think it might actually do more harm than good. </div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Ultimately, I think it remains a science because of the discipline required to become a psychologist, and not so much the \"practice\" of psychology. Medical doctors can practice medicine, and get better at it. The human body, after all, is just so much intricate plumbing and organic bits and bobs. The human mind, on the other hand, is infinitely more complicated, a multi-faceted riddle, wrapped in a sheath of millions of neurons, all firing in amaing ways to produce individual human beings, each with our own personalities, convictions, desires, fears, dislikes, and pleasures. </div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Without a great deal more study, how can we ever hope to claim that psychology is a real science? </div>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<blockquote><p>“It's the person who would sell his soul for a nickel, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of money.... Let me give you a tip on men's characters: the man who damns money has obtained it dishonorably; the man who respects it has earned it. Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That sentence is the...bell of an approaching looter.” -Ayn Rand</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ayn Rand was special, and not in a good way. She was a caustic, belligerent herald of the apocalypse that is raw, uncontrolled capitalism. And yet, Rand was simply a product of her time. [Keep in mind that this is not supposed to be an exhaustive analysis of the rise of Randian concepts, but just a loose overview of some of the things that led to the development of her ideas, so don’t troll me for being somewhat inaccurate, nerds. -TC]</p>\n<p>Following the American Civil War, people from the North migrated to the South to run for political office in order to foster change in the form of civil rights, economic growth, and found public school systems, though some did go to capitalize on the reconstruction boom. Hundreds of white women moved South to teach, while white men opened banks and offered high interest loans to those who sought to start businesses. It was an odd mix of capitalist and socialist drives.</p>\n<p>Following World War I (also known as The Great War and The War To End All Wars), America entered the Roarin’ Twenties, a period of strong economic, industrial, and cultural growth and change. Women gained the right to vote in many States. Air travel became a thing. The money was flowing. Ayn Rand left Russia to the United States in 1926, just three years before The Crash of 1929. She left what, at the time, was a dying Czarist Russia facing a growing revolutionary force living in crushing poverty, only to see the explosive crash of the American economy in 1929.</p>\n<p>After World War II there was another explosive period of economic growth and expansion. What the people saw, and not what was actually happening, was the government swoop in to take people and resources to get killed and destroyed, and that the private sector would swoop in afterwards and fix things up, make new things, give people jobs and money, and build entire communities through the apparent power and benevolence of Capitalism. Of course, we know that isn’t the accurate truth. Many of the companies that built the roads and dams and office buildings that towered into the sky were supported by plans devised and funded by the efforts of the US Government (<a href=\"https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPublic_Works_Administration&amp;data=02%7C01%7Ctyler.regas%40outlook.com%7C424608f4a68b40725a6208d514df4313%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636437871487005629&amp;sdata=U39jzOC1yd%2FJWvUp4kIO432fT1as17nZk35M%2FLNt1OU%3D&amp;reserved=0\">think New Deal and PWA</a>). But that’s not what people saw in their home towns.</p>\n<p>For her part, Rand saw capitalism, integrated with what she would call \"objectivism\", as the only way out for a truly free society. It was Capitalism that swarmed over the American landscape, transforming the troubled cities and towns into a gleaming series of metropolitan meccas, glittering with wealth and power and influence whilst ignoring the vast number of people that worked their asses off to make it happen, often to the sole benefit of a small number of people. Sort of like what we have today.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Objectivism holds that there is no greater moral goal than achieving happiness. But one cannot achieve happiness by wish or whim. Fundamentally, it requires rational respect for the facts of reality, including the facts about our human nature and needs. Happiness requires that one live by objective principles, including moral integrity and respect for the rights of others. Politically, Objectivists advocate laissez-faire capitalism. Under capitalism, a strictly limited government protects each person's rights to life, liberty, and property and forbids that anyone initiate force against anyone else. The heroes of Objectivism are achievers who build businesses, invent technologies, and create art and ideas, depending on their own talents and on trade with other independent people to reach their goals.

Rand gives all credit to the solitary, strong, rational capitalist who does what he wants, when he wants, and however he achieves that is good as long as it is all in the name on his happiness. This ideology enshrines selfishness and puts selflessness in the corner, facing the wall, wearing a dunce cap, which likely has you asking, “What about all of the backs upon which these powerful individuals have lifted themselves up?”</p>\n<p>Jon Donne wrote in 1624 in his work entitled <i>Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions</i>,</p>\n<blockquote><p>No man is an <i>Iland</i>, intire of it selfe; every man is a peece of the <i>Continent</i>, a part of the <i>maine</i>; if a <i>Clod</i> bee washed away by the <i>Sea</i>, <i>Europe</i> is the lesse, as well as if a <i>Promontorie</i> were, as well as if a <i>Mannor</i> of thy <i>friends</i> or of <i>thine</i> <i>owne</i> were; any mans <i>death</i> diminishes <i>me</i>, because I am involved in <i>Mankinde</i>; And therefore never send to know for whom the <i>bell</i> tolls; It tolls for <i>thee</i>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was written in old English, but its message is clear. No man is an island. If a stone is washed away from the shore, that land is the lesser for it. Donne wrote of a fact that we have known for many, many centuries; that we all make our experience here on this spinning rock in space, and Rand’s ideas that rugged individualism where selfishness is countenanced as vital is just piffle. I’d like to see John Galt build a bridge or cure cancer by himself.</p>\n<p><b>We’re All In This Together, Whether We Like It Or Not</b></p>\n<p>Aside from the despicable fact that Rand’s objectivism promotes the idea that only “producers” deserve to exist and all others should be allowed to fall away, the simple idea that money is a viable foundation for all things is just ridiculous. If it isn’t clear by now, money is a horrible influence on society. Money makes people hate each other, creates an environment where sanctioned and illegal theft and corruption is rampant, and ruins good people who have only ever done good by their fellow humans. Money is destructive and stifles the advancement of humanity as a whole.</p>\n<p>[No, I’m not ignoring the influences of religion and political ideologies, but this piece is about money. -TC]</p>\n<p>The only problem is that it’s everywhere. Currency is so deeply ingrained into our social fabric that we can’t just rip it out and cast it aside, and that’s a problem because we need to. If we don’t, the future of humanity will remain in the hands of those who are unscrupulous enough to steal it from everyone else. It is the Oroboros, the snake that eats its own tail. Money feeds the most depraved aspects of humanity which, in turn, makes money for those who engage in these deleterious behaviors. Money is a stand-in for power, and as we all know, \"might makes right\". So, if money is so important, how do you get rid of it?</p>\n<p>You use money to kill money.</p>\n<p>Yes, that sounds a tad cryptic, but bear with me. It’s a lot easier that you might think. It is, however, critical that you understand that what I’m about to discuss isn’t a step-by-step plan of action, but an idea to force money out of society and create a new form of society that just works, embraces equality and civil rights and abhors oppression, hate, fear, and disenfranchisement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, freeze prices on everything, like bullet time in The Matrix. Jail time for price gouging. There needs to be a \"No Scumbag\" provision to shut down corruption at its root. Besides, as you’ll see, there will be no effective value in raising prices or cheating.</li>\n<li>Second, flood the economy with an unlimited amount of money. Mint a fuckton of those trillion dollar coins and jam them into circulation.</li>\n<li>Third, doing this works because it doesn’t fundamentally change how society works, it just levels the playing field at which everyone plays. “When everyone is special, no one is special.” -The Incredibles.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, everyone is rich. With prices frozen, anyone can buy what they want and what they need. Housing will be built for the homeless, hunger will be eliminated, money will be spent on research of all kinds, goods and services will be distributed all around the world. The list of things that can get done is far too long for me to get right. Infrastructure, public transit, space exploration, development of renewable energy sources, the end of slavery, the drug trade, piracy, dictatorships, religious and ideological oppression, the expansion of education, the increase in workplace happiness as people move to the jobs they want instead of the ones they have to take just to keep their families afloat.</p>\n<p>While some will go hog wild and do some rather insane things, most people will get along with the business of life. People will follow their hearts. That’s because you can’t significantly change the nature of human behavior just by making everyone rich. Money will effectively become a method of tracking transactions, and slowly, over time, money will be replaced with processes, and lose all value. It will be replaced with the value that is inherent to all humans, to share and live and love and create and invent and do amazing things that we all know we can.</p>\n<p>We’ll all just be people, all working towards enriching humanity and preserving our existence for, hopefully, many thousands of years to come.<br></p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>Welcome to the brave new world of DESIGN OVER FUNCTION that <del>Jonny</del> <del>Johnnee</del> Jony Ive guy has crafted at Post Jobs Apple where a glass sandwich costs you $1,000 and you must pay for the privilege of using your purchased media in their walled garden. During Apple's unveiling of \"One more thing\" in the shiny new Steve Jobs Theater on the shiny new Cupertino campus, Craig Federighi tried to use Face ID to unlock the demo phone. It didn't work. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/14/apple-face-id-didnt-fail-at-iphone-x-launch-staff?utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_campaign=GU+Today+USA+-+Collections+2017&amp;utm_term=243634&amp;subid=20695922&amp;CMP=GT_US_collection\" target=\"_blank\">Today in The Guardian, there's a convenient PR piece explaining why.</a> </p>\n<p>Apparently, Apple peeps kept fingering the phone before the demo which locked out the Face ID because, well, it's supposed to. </p>\n<p>I don't have an issue with Face ID. What I do have an issue with is the wanton removal of effective, consistent, reliable features that everyone uses. I blame Steve Jobs and, to a greater degree, that annoying twat, Ive. First of all, when Steve came back to help (and then replace) Gil Amelio, he started cleaning house by closing down all of the projects Apple was developing, including my beloved Newton. Then Steve removed the floppy drive from the iMac. Removing old technologies in a smart manner was Steve's thing. In many cases it was brilliant. Now that Steve is dead, though, Ive is left to his own devices, and being the snob he is, he's been removing features that he shouldn't, in the belief that he's just carrying on Steve's vision of a feature-free future. </p>\n<p>So, now we get no headphone jack and no touch sensor, and everything is more complicated and annoying for it. </p>\n<p>Removing the floppy drive in the age of CD media was a no-brainer, at least in retrospect. What Apple is doing now is annoying people, forcing users to adapt to Apple's vision. Didn't anyone at Apple notice that people hold their phones WITH THEIR HANDS?!!?? And what comes on hands, but fingers, and those fingers have prints, and we have technology that can read those prints, and it functions quite well. I can pick up my phone and unlock it with my thumb in less than a second. No swiping. No holding the phone in a particular way. </p>\n<p>There is a critical point at which a form-factor reaches its lowest possible simplification point. For the smartphone, that is what we see in the OnePlus 5, Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy S8. They are thin and amazing and fast. They all have touch sensors. They all have headphone jacks. People love them. They buy millions of them. They also don't (quite) cost a grand for the cheap one (and the OnePlus is less than $500!!). </p>\n<p>This isn't all that Apple has done, or in some cases not done. The latest innovation in laptops is that stupid touchbar thing they added to the MacBook line. Yeah. Apple has also resisted potential growth areas inconsistently. Phablets became popular so they rolled out the iPhone 6 and 6s, but when they rolled out the iPad Pro to compete with Microsoft's Surface line, they saddled it with sad, little iOS. Don't even get me started about iTunes. What the hell is 2010 still doing on my desktop, Apple!!??</p>\n<p>So, in the end, Apple has jumped the shark, lost the thread, screwed the pooch (an awful saying, btw), and Tim Cook has simply handed the keys to a guy obsessed with design and nothing more. The only time we ever see Jonathan Ive is in videos. He's never there, lovingly walking us through his craft, passing on that passion. He \"phones\" it in. We don't know Ive as a person, but a idea. A concept. Even his Wikipedia entry is void of much detail after a certain point. </p>\n<p>I'm not disparaging Sir Jonathan Ive as a person, but it's clear that he's nothing without Steve Jobs at his side, guiding Ive's hand, moderating his extreme design impulses, and that's when Apple just breaks down and becomes another premium marquee with ho-hum product. </p>\n</div>\n",

The other was the band they ran for live shows. It would be easy to misunderstand that the two are not one in the same. I guess you could say that the live band played covers of their own music. I don't mean that as an insult. The albums are individual works of musical art, impossible to replicate live, even for Becker and Fagen. </p>\n<p>I am near tears as I write this, but my very first album ever was Can't Buy A Thrill and I have loved, adored, and revered Steely Dan every day of my life ever since. </p>\n<p>Much love to you for all you have ever given me, Walter. </p>\n</div>\n",

As was common in the Golden Age of comics, there's a lot of cannibalism. WW effectively is DC's Captain America, complete with a cadre of hardened war vets with distinct personalities, even a Scot with a funny hat. That, however, is NOT why I ultimately didn't like WW. It starts simply enough (don't worry, no significant spoilers). <br></p>\n<p>The Black nanny. <br></p>\n<p>Does anyone in Hollywood know what's going on? We're having a lot of issues with all kind of civil rights things, like trying not to marginalize Black people!? The top of the film features a young Diana Prince (she gets the last name later) running, only to find that she's run away from her Black mammy. Oh please. Diana is white. The Queen is white. Most talking parts are white, though there's one \"senator\" who gets, what, five words? Then there are issues with the special effects.</p>\n<p>Amazon flies off galloping horse, shooting an arrow while flipping, and landing on her feet. That would be nothing except she magically need not obey physics and the laws of motion. A horse is traveling at around 20 MPH, you jump off and try to land on your feet, what happens? If you do it like the Amazon, you smash your face into the ground. A bit later, a high leaping Amazon throws a pair of knives down towards the camera. If you look closely you can see that they leave her hand and minutely correct direction. <br></p>\n<p>The racial and social aspects are also a mostly subtle aspect of the film. First, there's the contrivance of sparks between Gadot and Pine. It's more staged then natural, though that's more a side effect of the less-than-elegantly formed dialogue. If that weren't cliche enough, there's the team. First, we get the Native American who talks earnestly about how the white man took their home and how he is better being free waging war in Europe. Seriously? Here's an idea. Don't steal homes from people, not that we can fix that now (though we can make reparations). Then there's the Middle Eastern fellow, Sameer, who chooses to fight as a mercenary since he isn't allowed to be an actor because of his color. These scenes don't have any honesty in them. They feel spliced in with a blunt butter knife. It's demoralizing. <br></p>\n<p>Then there are aspects of WW that don't add up. In the first battle scene, a sniper is suppressing WW and her team in a courtyard. Mr. Scottish sniper seems incapable of actually sniping (why is he there, again?), so Chris Pine hatches a plan. Three mortals run out and grab an enormous sheet of metal. They hoist it over their heads, and Diana uses it as a springboard to smash the bell tower to bits. I mean, it really explodes. The entire top of the building, gone. So, if she can do that, why can't she jump, what, 80 feet? Besides, she jumps higher than that earlier. <br></p>\n<p>Worse yet is the subtle, almost imperceptible misogyny. Simply put, you can't be a good woman, even a super powered woman, unless you have a man to coax it out of you, even if that man complacently supports the repression of women. While Chris Pine's performance is wonderful, his ultimate role is to be a guide to the real world outside of the sheltered world of Themyscira, the hidden island home of the amazons. They dance. They do it. He navigates her around. She, the nubile naif who doesn't understand the world as it truly is. <br></p>\n<p>I know these feel like nitpicks, and some are. The story, overall, is good. Most people who don't read comics likely don't know it, so it feels fresh. Gal Gadot is great as WW, though there need to be fewer SLOMO scenes of determined walking. Chris Pine is also great. Others have said that he is comfortable playing any role, leading or supporting. I think it's more than that. I believe that he's comfortable in his own skin and enjoys pretending, but doesn't need it. It's like any craft, and he is skilled. I don't, however, believe we've seen what he can truly do yet. I look forward to those days. <br></p>\n<p>I'm a little surprised that this is a blockbuster, to be honest. It's more like a Marvel film, if not quite so tight and lacking the easy banter. DC has set a low bar for entry, though, and Hollywood's latest entries have been, well, crap. So much money spent to achieve so little actual value. Sadly, I don't think Wonder Woman represents a turning point for the DC cinematic universe. I have a bad feeling that this is just an anomaly. <br></p>\n<p>Bummer.<br></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>It wasn't long ago that you couldn't walk down the street without \ntripping over some new Apple rumor or buzz over the latest and greatest \nApple gear. Now, it's all about the white noise we hear from the tech \nindustry as a whole. Are we living in a politics-style news bubble, is \nMicrosoft beating Apple at their own game, or does the Cupertino \nmegalith have something up its sleeve that would make the ghost of Steve\n Jobs giggle.</p>\n<p>I remember, albeit vaguely, when Steve Jobs rolled out the brand new iMac in 1998. You really had to be there to see it live, but I did manage to see it eventually. I was, at the time, an Apple \"phanboi\", Ever since my first Apple ][, I had loved Apple. I've had lots of Apple products. I drank the kool-aid, as it were. After all, Apple was just dropping new products like creepy old ladies drop candy on Halloween. The iMac, the PowerMac, then the shift to Intel and the advent of the MacBook. Then, like a bolt from the blue, the iPhone and the iPad.\n The computer industry was having a hard time keeping up. It looked like\n Apple had a crystal ball and the competition tried and failed to copy \nApple's formula, but Steve beat them handily, time and time again.</p>\n<p>Then Steve Jobs died.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry if that seems harsh (you might want to have that looked at), but it did happen. Tim Cook was installed as CEO\n to shepherd along what was already one of the single most valuable \ncompanies in the entire world. It didn't take long to see that Apple did\n not have a crystal ball, though. What they <em>had</em> was Steve Jobs.\n That's because, despite all of his ludicrous flaws and foibles that are common to genius, he had a crystal ball in his head. He could see the trend-makers and \nbeat the competition to the punch, but the one thing he couldn't do was teach that \ntrick to anyone else.</p>\n<p>Even with annoying British designer Jonny Ive\n at his side, Tim Cook has been struggling to define a course for Apple \nthat still pops out innovations. There was no Steve micromanaging every \ntiny detail every day, all day long. So, they just plodded along and \nstarted to copy what others had done while chasing them. The iPhone got bigger. The iPad\n got smaller. The Apple TV added voice and games. The Mac Pro got more \nexpensive. Every exercise that used to produce real innovation melted \nboorishly into iterative microchange with a premium price attached for good measure. Apple, in my estimation, jumped the shark around the iPhone 6s and/or iPad Pro.</p>\n<p>While the rest of the industry has now long been hawking the 2-in-1 lappy nee\n tablet in full awareness that the tablet industry is tailing off, Apple\n still makes nothing more than traditional laptops. Where you can get a \ntablet that runs full octane Windows 10, your iPad Pro still runs tablet software. Grab yourself an overpriced Samsung\n Galaxy S8 and you can take it swimming, where Apple still slaps you on \nthe wrist if you get their gear damp. If you want something hot and new \nin Apple products, just grab yourself the new MacBook Pro with it's amazing Touchbar, a video strip that replaces the function key row. huzzah.</p>\n<p>And, of course, everything Apple does is promoted with breathless intensity. Every event is Bob Hope's presentation of the recently risen Jesus Christ atop a gleaming, floating cloud hovering over Trump's Maralago. Yet, there were few showmen of the same caliber as Steve Jobs, and Cook has not followed in his mentors footsteps. Nobody has. The only person in tech today I can think of who has a presence as compelling as Jobs is Microsoft's Panos Panay. Panos is a natural on stage, speaks in an unscripted manner, interacts well with the crowd, and is enthusiastically hyper about Microsoft's Surface product line like an amp cranked up to 11. </p>\n<p>Now Apple rolls out a $5000 iMac Pro?! Is this Apple's response to Microsoft's astonishing, if subtly flawed, Surface Pro? I'm not going to dig into the world of pain that is Intel's i9 X-series multicore mega parts clusterfuck, but Apple has bought in completely. The stupid thing is that the X-series gear is designed for enthusiasts (sorta, more cobbled, but then I'm quibbling) and is meant to be built, not presented. Apple \"presents\" gear. You are meant to take it as it comes, use it as long as you can, and replace it with another steeply overpriced gadget they've breathlessly announced. In a sense, Apple is lucky that the mobile phone blew up, since that kind of gear is right up their alley. <br></p>\n<p>None of this bodes well for a company that has long been playing at the edges of marketshare. I don't mean to suggest that Apple will go away. Far from it, but it does risk sliding back into the same tasteless, colorless mire it did when they first lost Steve Jobs. It's a fascinating history and if you don't know it, go look it up. You'll be amazed. <br></p>\n<blockquote><p><i><b>TL;DR</b> - Steve brought in former Pepsi head John Scully to make corporate things work better after Apple's early success with the Apple ][. Following the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 and after a lot of grief in the executive suites later, the board votes to fire Steve and put Scully in the CEO spot to replace Mark Markkula (yeah, Steve wasn't CEO). Steve goes off to found NeXT and Pixar, while Mike \"The Diesel\" Spindler was screwing up Apple's next gen OS and mobile aspirations. This led to Gil Amelio signing his own pink slip by suggesting Apple bring Steve Jobs BACK to consult. Then iCEO Jobs cut loads of fat from Apple's projects roster, started work on Mac OS X, ushered in the iMac, and began the road to making Apple one of the most powerful companies in the world before he died. Crazy, eh.</i></p></blockquote>\n<p>Yes, Apple has a huge share of the market in the iPhone, but all of the momentum they built over the years with desktops, laptops, and mobile devices is starting to catch the edges of reality and slow down. I don't think Tim Cook has much longer as CEO, and somebody needs to hand that Ive dude a severance check. His moody crap is really starting to bother me. <br></p>\n</div>\n",

Cops outright murder Black people almost every day, and we get mad, but nothing changes. Our politicians lie, cheat, steal, and send dick pics to minors, and we get mad, but nothing changes. Companies like Facebook, Google, Uber, the entire oil industry, the entire pharmaceutical industry, the medical establishment sell each of us for $12 a year, tricks hundreds of thousands of people into indentured servitude, skirt the law with impunity, and price gouge with lip-licking voraciousness, and nothing changes. Banks, housing, dialysis, the battle for a living wage, the death of education, the abandonment of the separation of church and state, and much, much more is killing us all every day. <br></p>\n<p>And nothing changes.</p>\n<p>Sure, we get mad, we harangue people on the internet, we watch \"news\" programs that are little more than shills for an ideology, and nothing changes. That's because, those who benefit from the status quo have discovered a simple truth. As long as there are enough Americans making enough money to maintain a decent credit score and there's enough \"white\" noise in the media, nobody gives a fuck. </p>\n<p>Americans have their interests predetermined. Get born, go to school, get a job, buy a house, raise two and a half kids, buy a few cars, take a vacation every year on your tax return, enjoy blockbuster movies at your local cinema, keep the riff raff out of your neighborhood, keep your head down and go to church every Sunday, or at least on the major Christian holidays. Most of all, however, is don't question anything outside of your little sphere of reality. <br></p>\n<p>We've been conditioned to be selfish and think that's okay. There are many, many, MANY things wrong with American society, politics, education, social justice, healthcare, and a billion other things, but one of the biggest, simplest pieces is this grab, grab, grab ideal we have (that was an intentional reference to capitalist in chief, Trump). If we cared, stopping rape would matter. If we cared, women would have the same chances and choices as men. If we cared, we would make real reparations to native Americans and the descendants of slaves. If we really cared, we'd recognize that all of us are descended from immigrants, except the people we stole this country from in the first place, of course. <br></p>\n<p>So, until we decide we aren't going to be selfish and share just a little with everyone else, things won't change. <br></p>\n<p>And that really sucks. <br></p>\n</div>\n",

It's clear that they cribbed mostly from the original film and Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex (an anime series) to create a franken-movie, not bothering to understand that the film and the series are two different tales which just happen to use many of the same characters. Just to be clear, GITS: SAC is one of the best anime series ever made. It's the only anime series that ever made me weepy over a robot. A ROBOT. GITS, the feature film, is considered one of the best examples of the art of animation, up there with Akira, Wings of Honneamise, and most of Miyazaki-sans works. The new American GITS would be awesome as an episode of the new Mystery Science Theater 3000 series on Netflix. <br>As for the whitewashing, it's just plain stupid. Everybody is hating on it, and Hollywood isn't listening. Dumb. You idiots are already losing tons of money because people don't want to spend $50 to watch TV in a big room for a few hours. There's TV at home, and it has better stuff playing. Whitewashing is also racist and puerile. We've got enough hate going around without having it shoved in our faces by what's supposed to be entertainment. <br><br>If the racism wasn't enough, there's the shitty, moody pacing and the constant, nagging remedial reminders that \"Major\" isn't really human and that's what the story is supposed to be about. So, GITS 101... What makes a human human? Can a thing be human if it contains the mere consciousness of a being, or is that just a clever copy that only seems alive? Ultimately, it questions the soul and where it resides, if at all. This is a subtlety that American filmmakers just can't seem to grasp. <br><br>See, there's this thing in Japanese storytelling, and even I don't fully grok it but I believe I'm well ahead of the curve for Westerners, that focuses on the experiential aspects of a tale. For example, in Mamoru Oshii's 1995 theatrical version, there are extended scenes which feature nothing but Kenji Kawai's haunting vocal track and scenes of New Port City in Japan. Not a single aspect of this sequence adds anything to the story, considered criminal in Western film-making, but adds both a layer of familiarity and presence to the teeming locale and injects a deeply emotional tone through the score. <br><br>Japanese storytelling often features the seasons with special attention to Cherry blossoms in Spring, the beach in Summer, festivals and fireworks in Fall, and Christmas in Winter. My intuition tells me that this is derived from the strong sense of tradition in Japan as native Japanese people culturally seek out the beauty and significance of life, the world, nature, and even human works. These are the bits and bobs that get left out or wholly misunderstood when translating Japanese media into American fare.<br><br>And that's all I have to say on that. <br>\n</div>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>It's hard not to think of Pixar and, by extension Apple, as amazing American institutions built by the astonishing, guiding hand of the late Steve Jobs. Pixar, after all, has churned out a steady stream of box office smashes, with the occasional stumble. Yet, at the same time, Pixar has become a cancer that has infected the Western World's lauded history of traditional, hand-drawn animation like an invasive species. We are paying a very steep price for Pixar's success today, and for the foreseeable future. </p>\n<p>There is no question that Steve Jobs was a visionary and reshaped our expectations of computers and technology. He and friend Wozniak almost single-handedly created the personal computer market in the mid-70's. However, by 1985 he was ousted from his own company because he didn't fit the standard corporate mold. Steve didn't rest, however. He created NeXT Computers and later, Pixar. Pixar had a megahit with <i>Toy Story </i>in 1995 and Jobs sold NeXT to Apple in 1997. In that same year, Steve Jobs returned to Apple as Interim CEO. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.frontrowreviews.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Toy-Story-3.jpg\" title=\"Image: http://www.frontrowreviews.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Toy-Story-3.jpg\"></p>\n<p>While Jobs was reshaping what we understand as personal technology, Pixar was hard at work creating a new kind of animation using 3D rendering technology it had invented. That, however, is where the two diverge. As Apple created an environment where other manufacturers would start to compete with Apple, Pixar was starting to carve out a niche that would eventually become the entire market, forcing all comers to migrate to 3D or fall behind. </p>\n<p>It's hard to ignore a studio whose every release rakes in hundreds of millions worldwide, time after time, almost without fail. Even the films considered relative failures by critics made tons of money for Pixar and distributor, Disney. Spielberg, Katz, and Geffen's DreamWorks SKG was the first real studio practically formed to take Pixar head-on, and eventually it zeroed in on a number of critical hits, namely the popular <i>Shrek </i>franchise. Others would start to make their marks, as well, like Sony Animation, Blue Sky, and Universal. Even Disney started making 3D features in-house. </p>\n<p>1995 saw the theatrical release of six traditionally animated films and <i>Toy Story</i>, the first feature length 3D animated film. <i>Toy Story </i>went head-to-head with Disney's <i>Pocahontas </i>and <i>A Goofy Movie </i>and Amblin's <i>Balto</i>. By 2012 Pixar pitted the Celtic-themed <i>Brave </i>against seven CG-based and three stop motion films.*</p>\n<p>2011's <i>Winnie The Pooh </i>from Disney, was the last significant traditionally animated feature to be released in the US. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://basementrejects.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/winnie-the-pooh-2011-eeyore-kanga-roo-piglet-owl-rabbit-tigger-600x300.jpg\"></p>\n<p>2015 saw the release of Nickelodeon's <i>The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water </i>which featured traditional, CG, and live-action sequences, so can't be counted as a traditional film. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_animated_films#By_year\" target=\"_blank\">Feel free to poke around the lists yourself</a>, though it's quite depressing. In fact, Japan is the only major media producer that predominantly uses traditional animation, though it is commonly blended with cost-saving CG backgrounds and other non-character elements. Most Japanese feature-film releases are also traditionally animated, and Japan's most applauded animation director, Hayao Miyazaki, only rarely applies the use of CG animation, and never to anything important. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Image result for Spirited Away\" src=\"http://wallpoper.com/images/00/40/69/20/spirited-away_00406920.jpg\"></p>\n<p>So, the result has been the almost complete dissolution of Western traditional animation studios. Period. It's not really a matter of the efficiency of output, after all, Japan produces a literal fuckton of animation over four seasons each and every year. It seems like it's come down to mere one-upmanship, and that sucks for animators or anyone who wants to go into animation. </p>\n<p>Traditional animation is an art form. It is based purely in art as a creative, visual outlet that springs from human hands and is viewed by human eyes. While 3D animation can, and often is, beautiful, it is far less organic in variance, creative and/or cultural diversity, and frequently devoid of emotional impact. That last bit is critical. Sure, a story can be strong, and when edited together well, with good voice acting, and a compelling soundtrack, a CG film can be emotionally engaging. They simply lack the additional tonal quality of analog. </p>\n<p>Like vinyl records. </p>\n<p>* NOTE: All films noted or referenced were released primarily in the US market. <br></p>\n</div>\n",

I hate it. The entire opening musical sequence, so full of life and deeply engaging in the animated feature, is dead, limp, and lifeless. Everything after that is a disjointed, misshapen mutation of the brilliant, reinvigorating, emotional feature-length animated version from 1991. </p>\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"httpsi0wpcommedia2slashfilmcomslashfilmwpwp-contentimagesBeauty-and-the-Beast-belle-songjpg\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/media2.slashfilm.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/Beauty-and-the-Beast-belle-song.jpg\" height=\"785\" title=\"Image: https://i0.wp.com/media2.slashfilm.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/Beauty-and-the-Beast-belle-song.jpg\"><p>Disney had a hit in 1977 with The Rescuers, but were having trouble with 1981's The Fox &amp; The Hound, 1985's The Black Cauldron, and 1986's The Great Mouse Detective. They struck gold in 1989 with The Little Mermaid and 1991's Beauty &amp; The Beast would be the first two steps in a long string of successes (barring 1995's Pocahontas, but that's just me). Had they not buggered about with their long history of storytelling, we might not have ended up with a 2017 version. <br></p>\n<p>My recommendation to Disney? Stop it. Do NOT remake one of the most beloved animated films of all time, The Lion King. Stop all plans for other remakes. People don't want Live Action. They want new stories, not rehashed versions of old stories. If they hadn't remade Beauty &amp; The Beast, then they wouldn't have invited discussions of misogyny and rape culture. It would have remained one of Disney's greatest films. Now it's just poop. <br></p>\n<p>Hollywood is having a hard time making ends meet, with fewer people going to theaters to see films. It doesn't help that It costs nearly $50 for a family of four to see one movie and that TV series from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, HBO, and others are far more engaging and far more affordable. It's also not helpful that most movies that come out of Hollywood these days are designed for the Chinese boxoffice. After all, the money goes where the money is, and America, you just ain't it anymore. <br></p>\n<p>The bigger problem, aside from the economy and jobs not being where Washington would like us to think it is (sorta non-sequitur and kinda not), that, and I know you're not expecting this, Pixar ruined everything. In 1995, Pixar dropped a bomb on the animated film industry with Toy Story,and have since made precious few missteps until being acquired by Disney in 2006.</p>\n<p>More insidious, however, is that Pixar did for Hollywood what Apple had done for technology, changed the two industries forever. There's no question that Steve Jobs was an amazing person, and he did usher in a wide range of technological advances via Apple, but the same can't be said for animation. The sad truth is that Pixar killed traditional, hand-drawn animation as an American art form. <br></p>\n<p>I don't mean to suggest that 3D animation isn't a form of art. Indeed, it can be beautiful as Pixar, Blue Sky, Dreamworks, and others have shown, but it is not the evolution of animation. We've seen too many times complaints like those about the characters from Frozen looking exactly like the characters from Tangled, probably because they do. Traditional, hand-drawn animation allows for any number of styles. <br></p>\n<p>Mulan features stylized Chinese art forms. Lilo &amp; Stitch featured Chris Sander's unique character design and beautiful watercolor backgrounds instead of the traditional gouache. The Emperor's New Groove featured character designs based on South American art styles. Hercules drew from Roman forms of art and architecture for it's look. It's hard to say where any 3D animated film draws its inspiration from. <br></p>\n<p>So, that's pretty much it. America needs to get back to its roots and stop trying to make shortcuts to everything. We need to stop killing art and demonizing the artistic. Disney needs to get back to creating amazing, hand-drawn animation and soon, or it will become the company whose pillars are Marvel and Star Wars and a bunch of old stuff they used to make. What a legacy, Bob. What a legacy.<br></p>\n<br>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>I've talked about this before. I don't talk about being homeless a lot. It's painful, living in hotels for two and a half years. It's a short story if I leave out a lot of the detail. Two and a half years ago, around Christmas, we were evicted from our apartment in Mission Viejo because my publisher sat on their asses getting my advance check to me for my book, Getting An IT Help Desk Job For Dummies (available on Amazon, cheap plug). I worked my ass off to finish that book. 330 pages in three months. They didn't care. Companies don't care, so we were screwed. We figured we'd be out for a month or two then find a new place.</p>\n<p>The thing is, nobody would take us. <br></p>\n<p>It's easy. Just have the biggest recession since The Great Depression, mix in one guy with no college degree and 20 years of professional writing and IT experience, a disabled daughter, and a wife who has to take care of said daughter 24/7, then throw in shitty credit and families that lack any kind of real empathy, and you have us. By 2008 I was making $75,000 a year with full benefits. After the recession hit, I could barely make $20 an hour on contract. I moved from job to job, working my ass off, mostly for idiots who refused to listen to simple reason, but those are different stories. <br></p>\n<blockquote><p><b><i>I will say, I had this one client for six months. He ran a small business in Tustin. He wanted to automate his business operations, and had heard I was the guy. We talked and he told me he wanted a system that did X, Y, and Z and all for free. I told him that X and Y could be done but that Z would need to be handled by a different tool and there would need to be integration and that he'd have to spend some money. He hired me, but he didn't listen. I spent six months trying to convince him that there was no way in hell there was any system out there that would do exactly what he wanted, out of the box, for nothing. Nice guy, but dumb as a box of bricks.</i></b></p></blockquote>\n<p>Eventually, the jobs ran out. Nobody was hiring any more and the economy was changing. I was too old, had too much experience, and didn't have a degree. I worked for SendGrid for almost a year earning $65,000 with meager benefits, but was fired after I pointed out some marketing material lied about some stuff the company was capable of doing for clients. Learn that as a lesson, kids. Honesty doesn't win you anything in this world. I got a gig with Mirantis for a bit, but their own internal squabbling resulted in my position being eradicated before I could even get started, so there's that. <br></p>\n<p>That's when the book gig landed on my feet, which ultimately resulted in us losing our apartment. We fought tooth and nail to get back on our feet. We begged and begged and begged. We fought with our respective fathers, Rima and I. I've personally spent what seems like months worth trying to convince my father that the help he was giving us wasn't helping. We made several abortive attempts to buy an RV to live in, one of which resulted in us getting robbed outright to the tune of $3,500, by a former OC Sheriff, no less. All the while, Rima is keeping Leah in school and getting a college education, and I eventually start working for Uber. All that time, we still have to pay the hotel, usually money we didn't have. <br></p>\n<p>So, two years later, we're still in hotels and we get a letter from the Anaheim Housing Authority. They've pulled Leah from the California State Section 8 waiting list at the request of Regional Center of Orange County, the State services group that helps with her disabilities. So, we did as they asked and we started to feel as if things were finally going to change. <br></p>\n<p>We filled out the application while at a hotel in Santa Ana. The forms said we didn't have to live in Anaheim, but apparently that's not how they feel internally, so we were declined. We moved to a hotel in Anaheim and applied again. They looked over everything and we were declined again, this time for insufficient information. Of course, we had sent the information, it's just that someone else looked at the file and didn't know what was going on, so they sent out the denial. Maybe I could get a job there making their shit work. <br></p>\n<p>Finally, we get them to understand they have what they asked for and they finally approve our application! Good lord, the heavens opened up that day, but only about a fraction of a second. So, we go in, have a meeting, get our fingerprints taken, a background check run, and handed a voucher to go talk to a landlord at one apartment building. That's where we find out about Kathy. Kathy Nutter. Kathy Nutter, the head of the Orange County Community Housing Corporation, a non-profit group that has been operating in Anaheim for 40 years. <br></p>\n<p>She was so nice. She talked to us, we told her our story, and she empathized! So few people were doing that, it felt new. She agreed to let us rent from her and we started doing the paperwork. She arranged to have some couches a board member was giving away moved in and it turned out her daughter had a fridge she didn't need anymore, so we got that too. We finalized things, got the keys, and started moving our stuff. <br></p>\n<p>That turned out to be a mistake. <br></p>\n<p>When we had first seen the apartment, we didn't see any cockroaches or smell anything, but by the time we started moving in, we found the roaches everywhere and a smell of urine in the kitchen that was just overbearing. We stayed in the hotel one more night. The next night, out of money from the move, we stayed at the apartment. We cobbled together sleeping arrangements and eventually fell asleep, only to be awoken by the screams of our daughter who had roaches crawling on her face and body. We haven't stayed there another night since. <br></p>\n<p>We told Kathy what happened and she appeared to be shocked. She said she'd have the maintenance people over there in no time to take care of things. They sprayed something and went away. A few days later, when we checked, we found plenty of roaches so we told Kathy again. She sent her people over again and they put down gel and gave us bugbombs. We bagged up some of our things that weren't in boxes and set off about eight bombs. Two days later, we find plenty of roaches dead, but more than enough to sustain horror alive and well, crawling all over the place. <br></p>\n<blockquote><p><i><b>Kathy said she'd never had a complaint of roaches or bad smells before. Funny thing is, I spoke to a neighbor and she said they had roaches and had complained many times, and that a sewer line had broken last year and stunk up the entire building for several weeks. Wow.</b></i><br></p></blockquote>\n<p>We've taken pictures and videos. We've documented all of our communications with Kathy. We gave her every chance in the world to make it right, and she didn't take a single one. It turns out that the loving, friendly, helpful, generous Kathy Nutter we thought we knew was just another sleazy slumlord like all the rest. The rent for that place was $1400. We were going to pay less than $400 a month for our share, the Anaheim Housing Authority would cover the $1,100 remaining, and it was a pig sty at best. <br></p>\n<p>Now, I haven't even mentioned the homeless guy living, literally, on our front doorstep or the half dozen or so drug dealers who were running shop in the alleyway behind the building. Everything about this deal just felt shady, and we were being screwed over royally. We thought we were safe, having made it into the helpful arms of a HUD approved group. Things just keep getting better, though. <br></p>\n<p>We asked Kathy to reimburse us for the cost of the hotel. That was denied. We asked for compensation for the money we spent moving in. That was denied. We contacted AHA and asked them to come look at the place again. They did that, saw how bad things were, and said they would cancel their contract with OCCHC. They then suggested we move into another apartment, which looked good from what we could tell, but turned out to be managed by Kathy Nutter, as well. Isn't that a kick in the pants!?</p>\n<p>So, we are now asking the AHA to help us get on another waiting list or help us fix this problem some other way, and so far we haven't heard back yet. It seems they might have hung us out to dry, as well. Only time will tell. <br></p>\n<p>To get our money back, we need to take the OCCHC to court. Small claims. Yay. So that's what we're doing now. And back in a hotel. Me, three weeks into a horrible backpain episode. Leah still going to school. Bills have to be paid. Paychecks only come in when they do, and it's all hell. <br></p>\n<p>So, this is that Fuck You I was talking about. It's the Fuck You that the Universe is giving us. The Jumbo Middle Finger of Fate. <br></p>\n<p>I tell you, it's the most awesome thing ever. <br></p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>You know, if more Americans watched Chinese movies, they might understand films like The Great Wall better. I'm more of a Japanophile myself, but I watch a good number of Chinese epics. Netflix is loaded with them, and some of them are quite good.</p>\n<p>The thing you need to understand about Chinese culture is that the ideal of working for the benefit of the whole has been around for a lot longer than <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution\" target=\"_blank\">Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution</a> (communism, if you didn't learn about Mao in school). The other thing you need to understand is the Chinese love for tales of mythology. Chinese culture has been around for a very, very long time, so they've got a lot of them. <br></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/avF6GHyyk5c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Now, before we get to the idea of whitewashing, I'll say up front, I disagree. Matt Damon plays a white dude who tries to get to China to trade for gunpowder. Despite being a highly skilled mercenary who is mad down with the bow and arrow skills, he loses all but one of his cohort, only to be taken into custody by the Chinese Army at the eponymous wall. <br></p>\n<p>Without revealing any spoilers, I'll say that Damon's stonehearted mercenary is ultimately swayed by the amazing qualities of the Chinese people to connect and fight a shared enemy. He learns that there is much more to life than just fighting for food and money. I'm not suggesting that China has been this oasis from pain and fear and life as we now it all this time, nor that communism is a fix for our ails, but this is what drives a primary element of Chinese culture if you're going to watch these films. <br></p>\n<p>On that note, if you want to see some subtly subversive Chinese film making, check out Chronicles of The Ghostly Tribe. On its surface, it looks like a love letter to the Cultural Revolution, but just check out the overtly hyper-positive attitudes and glassy-eyed recitation that makes it more clownish than oppressive. It's not a bad film, either. <br></p>\n<p>The only thing I want to say now is that you should give this film a chance. It's an epic fantasy that might even be a little too short to tell the entire tale, but it works. You can even skip the beginning bit right up until they get to the Great Wall. That's where I would have started the film with a short, explanatory preamble. <br></p>\n</div>\n",

That flying rat. The one and only flying hero in Overwatch, is the single most annoying hero of the bunch. Nobody else can fly. Mercy can glide and Winston can jump really far, but no other hero has flight capability like Pharah, which makes her suck. Pharah's missiles are also quite lethal, which means anyone playing her who is even vaguely good at twitch games can do a load of damage, and it's very difficult to counter her.</p>\n<p>Counter her with a sniper, like Ana or Widow, and it works, but they have to be really good snipers. Counter her with Torbjorn, and her missiles can ditch that Swedes turret in a couple of shots before the gun's bullets can deal enough damage. Counter her with another Pharah, and its like watching two first-timers have a dogfight. <br></p>\n<p>So, Blizzard. Dump Pharah. Having a single hero that can control the skies is just dumb.

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>You might not have noticed, since you’re most likely looking at your \nsmartphone, but a significant amount of time people spend on the \ninternet is through a mobile device, dominantly said smartphone. We’ve \ngot some nifty charts lined up from ComScore so you can see just how \nmuch.</p>\n<p>[[Had an image here, but need to go track it down. Hopefully I don't forget. ed.]]<br></p>\n<p>As is illustrated in the above chart, things start shifting around \n2012 when mobiles started to take over from desktops (this includes \nlaptops, I presume), and that gap continues to widen. In general, this \nshows what we likely already know just from looking around; when you \nneed the internet, you reach for your phone around two out of every \nthree times. What’s even more interesting is that age is not a factor \nanymore. Older people may not use the internet as much, or grab their \nsmartphone as often, but the trend is remarkably stable across the \nscope.</p>\n<p>[[Same here. ed.]]<br></p>\n<p>In all cases, 19 to 65 and up, people tend to grab their smartphone \nfirst. This chart shows it’s when the user has both a smartphone and a \ntablet, but the trending is clear. Mobiles are taking over the internet.\n What you don’t need a chart to see is that so-called phablets appear to\n have won, with even Apple having rolled out a larger mobile with the \nrelease of the iPhone 6 Plus, but that’s a discussion for another story.\n Here, we are going to talk about the future of computing, and the above\n data is where we are at now.</p>\n<h3>Pocket Power</h3>\n<p>Computing comes in many diverse forms these days, there are \nsmartphones (natch), feature phones (the not-cool ones), tablets, \nlaptops in various form factors, and desktops of endless variety. If \nonly that were it, however. There are also smart TVs, smart DVD and \nBlu-Ray players, video game consoles like the Wii U, PlayStation 4, and \nthe Xbox One, scads of media devices like Apple TV, Roku, and the Chrome\n Stick, and enough smart watches to choke a Blue Whale. If that wasn’t \nenough, there are photo frames, radios, and even TV remotes that use the\n internet to make them better (though that’s debatable).</p>\n<p>In part, it’s no wonder people gravitate to their mobile devices when\n seeking information. There’s so much… internet, it’s hard to break it \ndown into the small, easy-to-swallow pieces user’s desire. This is a \nprimary emotional component in why certain apps do so well on the \nvarious App Stores. The better an app performs at granting the desired \ninstant gratification, the more likely users will treat it as their \nGo-To solution. It explains a lot when you consider that desktops in \ngeneral don’t have “apps” and tablets can’t fit in your pocket (ignoring\n that some phones have a hard time fitting into the average pocket). To \ntheir credit, Microsoft does have apps on their Windows 8 and 10 \ndesktops, but the app store has yet to mature and present developers \nwith an enticing potential marketplace.</p>\n<h3>Future Tense</h3>\n<p>As you can well imagine, with PC sales dropping like a stone and \nsmartphone and tablet sales soaring, systems producers are scrambling to\n figure out what the consumer is going to want in the next two to five \nyears, and it’s hard to imagine where that might go. I thought I’d have a\n think on it and see if I can’t use the old Predict-O-Tron to suss out a\n few things. First, however, let’s remind ourselves about the categories\n we’re looking at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mobile phones (i.e., Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and other mobile OS)</li>\n<li>Ultraportable devices (i.e., iOS &amp; Android tablets, ChromeBooks)</li>\n<li>Portable devices (i.e., PC &amp; Mac tablets, laptops, 2-in-1s, convertibles)</li>\n<li>Micro systems (i.e., PC sticks, Intel NUC, &amp; other tiny non-portables)</li>\n<li>Desktop systems (i.e., small form factor, mini tower, tower, and All-in-one systems)</li>\n<li>Gaming systems (i.e., Microsoft’s Xbox One, Sony’s PlayStation 4, Nintendo’s Wii U)</li>\n<li>Smart systems (i.e., home media, TVs, and DVD/BR players)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With that in mind, let’s dig into what might happen by 2020:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>The Phablet</strong> – I don’t think phone sizes are going \nto increase much from here on out. There’s little incentive for \nconsumers to have a seven or eight inch phone they can’t fit into their \npockets. 5-5.5″ devices are going to inhabit the sweet spot in this \nmarket, while smaller devices will continue to fill the needs of the \nbudget market. As always, there will be outliers, but they will be few \nand, unless extremely crafty, won’t last long. Advances will continue in\n hardware and software development. We’ll likely see better cameras, \nsome interesting iterations of curved displays, and desktop-style \ndocking as Microsoft revealed with its new Lumia 950 and 950XL. I have a\n feeling that we might see some edge-less displays in the next few \nyears, which would allow the introduction of a workable folding device.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The CPU</strong> – Not many people but hardcore nerds talk \nabout CPUs all that much, but they are critical to computing. Clock \nspeeds won’t likely get any higher. They’ve been in stasis for a number \nof years already. What has grown are the number of cores, the efficiency\n of manufacturing, and the ability to reduce the amount of heat \nproduced. One key example is Intel’s Atom line. When they first \nappeared, they were anemic and slow. The current crop is fast, capable, \nand efficient. As such, we will continue to see advances in multi-core \nparts, further reductions in heat production and power consumption, and \nincreased functionality to handle complex operations and multi-tasking.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Desktop systems</strong> – Due to the continued \nminiaturization of computer tech, we will witness the ongoing death of \nthe general purpose desktop. The “box” remains a staple in enterprise \ndeployments, but even that’s being eaten away by the laptop. The \nconsumer market is already being euthanized with tablets and will likely\n be replaced by the selection of small form factor and tiny desktop \nsystems like Intel’s NUC series and an increasing number of all-in-one \nsystems similar to Apple’s iMac. I have a feeling these won’t catch \nfire, but they will maintain at least some level of presence in the \nmarket.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The Laptop</strong> – If anything has been an effective \nagent of chaos against the forces of the desktop, it’s the laptop. Long \ngone are the days when a laptop was three or more times more costly than\n a desktop PC, and with the growing performance of low cost CPU parts, \nthe multi-component relic of the PC just isn’t appetizing to many \nconsumers. Yet, since the introduction of the iPad, Apple’s ultimate \ndisruptor, the laptop has been facing it’s own foe, and fought back \nhard. The disastrous “netbook” era was short lived and ill conceived as a\n possible combatant to the tablet, so more tablets were released.<br>\nThe most compelling change in the laptop battle, however, is \nconvergence. In other words, if you can’t beat them, join them, or, if \nyou’re the Borg, assimilate them. Asus’ popular Transformer line of \n2-in-1 devices is testament to that, but it’s Microsoft’s surprise \nrollout of the gorgeous and amazing Surface Book that is likely going to\n act as a template for the future of the laptop. By simply removing the \ndisplay, you get a tablet PC. Reattaching the display, you get a full on\n laptop with longer battery life and even gaming-grade discrete graphics\n as an option. I predict that various forms of this configuration will \nbecome popular. There is, however, the matter of systems interconnect. \nAfter all, nobody will want a tablet that weighs five pounds, even if it\n sports a Core i7 and 32GBs of RAM. We may see some very interesting \ninnovations in this particular space.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>All The Others</strong> – There’s not much more to say, \nreally. Gaming systems are going to get more game-ier. It’s unlikely \nthat Sony or Microsoft will diverge from their course. Both command very\n lucrative markets and both see only each other as their nemesis. \nNintendo, on the other hand, literally owns the mobile, dedicated gaming\n market, but still have to wage war against the monster that is \nsmartphone gaming. I’d bet my shirt that Nintendo knows they need to \nemphasize that some games are just better with physical controls and \nwill offer some spin on that when codename “NX” is revealed sometime \nnext year. They’ve finally figured out they need to release some games \non iOS and Android, but to really thrive they need to continue to \ninnovate.<br>\nSmart devices are going to get smart-ier. It’s not clear what will \nhappen in the smart device vs. smart add-on war. Smart TVs lock you into\n that manufacturers ecosystem, while add-on devices like the Roku offer a\n much wider range of options. It will be interesting to see if anyone \ndevelops a line of TVs that have a low-cost, interchangeable dock in the\n foot that allows the attachment of an Apple TV or Roku 4 box and just \nbypass “smart” altogether. That’d be smart, if you’ll pardon the pun. If\n anything takes off in consumer electronics, though, I think it will be \nbetter, open, touch-and-pair wireless display technology using a \ncombination of NFC and Wifi. The stupid dongle thing is a nuisance and \nrestrictive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general, much of what is likely to come in the next five years \nwon’t be astonishing, but iterative, an evolution, if you will, and much\n of it will allow access to the internet in some form. I can’t predict \nmajor breakthroughs that we’ll need to move beyond where we are now, but\n there’s still plenty of room in the tech that we have to continue \ndevelopment. For example, if the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160811084647/http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/devices/surface-book?SEMID=1&amp;WT.srch=1&amp;ocid=OCWin10Red_SEM_BNG_MSBranded_FAM_en-US_surface%20book&amp;wt.mc_id=OCWin10Red_SEM_BNG_MSBranded_FAM_en-US_surface%20book\" target=\"_blank\">Surface Book</a>\n were to really spawn a PC replacement market, it would need to have \nenough functionality to operate as a tablet without the base, but still \nbe able to offer real power when docked. That’s going to require some \nreal innovations in board-level interconnectivity as well as license \nallowances for dual CPU systems in the consumer market.</p>\n<p>I also expect we’ll see some new takes on the docked smartphone \ntablet in the next few years. If you look at how Microsoft uses a tiny \nlittle dock to turn their <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160811084647/http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/phone/lumia950/\" target=\"_blank\">Lumia 950</a> and <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160811084647/http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/phone/lumia950-xl/\" target=\"_blank\">Lumia 950XL</a>\n into a desktop analog, you can easily imagine that functionality being \nintegrated into tablet and laptop forms. It’s just dead until you slide \nin your phone. This is nothing new. The <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160811084647/http://www.palminfocenter.com/foleo/\" target=\"_blank\">Palm Foleo</a>\n was one of the more beautiful implementations of this concept, but it \nwas cancelled before it was released. There was going to be a Foleo 2, \nbut that never took form as Palm was falling apart, was bought by HP, \nand then unceremoniously shut down. More recently, the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160811084647/http://www.amazon.com/AT-Laptop-Dock-Motorola-ATRIX/dp/B004M17D62?SubscriptionId=AKIAIKBZ7IH7LXTW3ARA&amp;&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B004M17D62&amp;tag=wwwbookcompar-20&amp;ascsubtag=5629a04648308f0c70993893\" target=\"_blank\">Motorola Atrix 4G and the optional laptop dock</a> was actually available, but <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160811084647/http://clamcase.com/clambook-android-and-iphone-laptop-dock/gallery.html\" target=\"_blank\">Incipio’s Clambook</a> never really materialized. About the only place you can get such functionality is <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160811084647/http://us.blackberry.com/software/desktop/blackberry-blend.html\" target=\"_blank\">BlackBerry’s elegant Blend for OS 10.3</a>,\n Windows and Mac OS X desktop software that lets you work on your \nBlackBerry via your system’s keyboard and mouse, even without a direct \ninternet connection.</p>\n<p>Whatever happens, though, it promises to be interesting. After all, \nwe’ve seen Apple copying from others instead of defining the market and \nMicrosoft come from being an oldster with stars in it’s eyes about the \nGood Old Days to being one of the hottest shops for real innovation in \njust the last few years. It’s going to be a real hoot to see what comes \ndown the pike next to thrill and entice us.<br></p>\n</div>\n",

Following in the \nfootsteps of AltaVista and Yahoo!, Google had made the internet \naccessible. PHP, Java, and Ajax were coming on strong and reforging \nplain HTML to make the internet usable. Creative types and entrepreneurs\n were developing new ways to leverage the internet. Sure, there were \nugly things like HoTMaiL, GeoCities, and MySpace, but we also got \nYouTube, Amazon, WikiPedia, CraigsList. GMail showed up, Facebook took \nits early steps, and Twitter popped up out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>There\n were also a lot of ads. Corporate Earth had found the internet to be a \nnew resource to exploit, and exploit it did. This was the era of the \ninternet that created the need for the pop-up blocker feature being \nadded to just about every browser on the planet. New advances in \nweb tech also created news ways for site developers to be more efficient\n and more expressive. This created the Flash revolution and early \nJavascript-based pop-ups. Both website owners and ad network owners were\n having conniptions over click rates and revenues, and web users were \ngetting really sick of ads splashed into every corner.</p>\n<p>Hell, they still are.</p>\n<p>Yet Google built their entire empire, one of the largest companies on\n Earth, almost entirely on the simple concept of plain text ads that \ndidn’t stand out like a sore thumb, but few others followed that lead. \nFrom this incomplete history, admittedly lacking nuance, we know today \nthat advertising on websites is deeply annoying. We have interstitials, \nads which pop up between stories on some websites or when you jump from \none site to another to keep you from reading before you look at the \nsponsor’s message. We have all manner of Javascript-based pop-ups that \nappear when you scroll down far enough, try to click the Close Tab \ncontrol, or flip up to ask you to complete a survey telling them how \nmuch you loathe their website because of the ads. Even I use them to \nhawk my book or get you to follow me on Twitter.</p>\n<blockquote><p>DISCLOSURE: I employ Google’s AdSense on my site and a \nfew others and, get this, I earn a whopping $30 a month. It pays a few \ninternet-related bills. whee.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Then there’s the “Despicable”-class items. These are more behaviors \nthan actual ads. The most common one people come to know and despise is \nLink Bait, links with titles shrouded in mystery, dropping just enough \nbombshell to get you to click. Then, of course, the resulting page is \nsaturated in ads. One of the even more painful forms of this is the \n“Amazing List”-class. Here’s a simple tutorial; think up something gross\n or sexual, find five or more celebrities who have possibly admitted to \ndoing it, create a gallery of these entries with one entry per page, \nentitle it something like “7 Celebrity Men Who Have Worn Women’s \nPanties”, now advertise. Guess what! Schlubs have to load that many \npages, each full of ads, just to get through the list. Hideous.</p>\n<p>Enter\n the Ad Blocker. Ad blockers promise one thing; to block ads from \nappearing in your browser. The results are simply astounding, if you use\n the right one. I personally use AdBlock, a plugin for Chrome on \nWindows, which effectively blocks all ads I don’t want to see, but \nallows advertisers who behave responsibly to display their tasteful ads.\n AdBlock is one of the most popular because it works well. In fact, it \nworks so well, the internet advertising industry and sites that derive \nrevenue from ads instead of subscriptions is engaging in collective \nhowls of “foul” claiming that it works too well and too many people are \nusing it. They’re simply loosing too much money and they’ll have to stop\n publishing if we don’t let them violate our eyeballs with their ads (or\n the ears of our deaf friends who must endure hideously convoluted crap \nin their screen readers).</p>\n<p>It’s gotten so bad, in fact, that now it’s difficult to go to just \nabout any website without seeing some pop-up (am I the only one seeing \nthe irony here?) begging visitors to please whitelist their site so they\n can continue to exist. Some truly heinous asshats will just block the \ncontent altogether until you disable your ad blocker. If that wasn’t bad\n enough, ads are just about everywhere. They’re in our Free-To-Play \ngames, which should really be called \nFree-To-Play-But-Costs-Money-To-Play-Well games. They flash brightly on \ngiant electronic signs in our cities, blinding us while we drive at 80 \nMPH on the freeway. They invade our shows on Hulu, even when we pay a \nsubscription fee (that’s changed lately, but it illustrates the point). \nWe’ve been fed pre-movie ads in the form of trailers for so many \ndecades, we now look forward to them! Billions of revenue dollars flow \nfrom one corporate entity to the next because of ads, but ad blockers \nhave been putting a dent in that, at least on the internet.</p>\n<p>Well, so what!</p>\n<p>Who\n cares if you obnoxious ad people and website operators complain that \nnot every human being on Earth is actively enthralled by your \nshort-form, advert-oriented expositions of so-called creativity. You are\n hawking stuff and not everybody wants to look at gaudy promotional \nmaterial every waking minute of every day so you can make a few more \nmillions, shocking though that may be. If your damned ads weren’t so \nfreakishly annoying and obtrusive, we probably wouldn’t be blocking \nthem! They slow down page loading times. They require plugins people \ndon’t want or need and likely shouldn’t be using because they open \nsecurity holes on their systems. Ad networks have even been a source of \nviral attacks on millions of unsuspecting people who never once thought \nthey may get a virus from their respectable website.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, you are exploiting us and we don’t like it. We now \nhave the power to stop it on the internet, and that bothers you. When \nReplay TV and TiVo first came out, they had the ability to skip ads. \nWhere’s Replay TV now? Dead. Where’s TiVo? They had to cripple the \nfunction to survive, but have recently announced their new console that \nbrings back Replay TV’s long coveted 30-second jump, thumbing their \nnoses that their oppressors. Millions of people are cutting the cord, \nditching cable TV, and getting subscriptions to Netflix, Hulu’s new \nad-free program, and just getting TV the old fashioned way, through an \nantenna. YouTube even has an ad-free service for $10 a month.</p>\n<p>Nobody loves your ads because you abuse it and there are some people \nwho will take that abuse to the extreme. So, here’s the breakdown. You \nstop horribly exploiting us users and we’ll stop blocking your entirely \nreasonable, unobtrusively placed ads and you can go on making revenue.</p>\n<p>Better yet, why not try charging a super-small monthly fee to go \nad-free, and no, you don’t get to spam those who don’t pay. Just \nconsider asking for a few bucks a month. This is the internet, after \nall. You can reach millions of people instead of a few thousand in a \nneighborhood. You can make real money. It’s not that hard.</p>\n<p>Look at Google.</p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>I was a smoker of 30+ years. I smoked a pack a day and, for a few \nyears, I smoked two packs a day. Almost two and a half years ago, I \ntried an e-cigarette and I stopped smoking and started vaping. Millions \nof smokers try to quit every year and fail. They try patches and gum and\n drugs, but none of it works effectively. Electronic cigarettes, \nhowever, have been exceedingly effective in smoking cessation. I don’t \nthink it’s a bad thing to regulate e-cigs and I’m not keen on kids \ngetting into vaping because of the candy-flavored juices, but that’s no \nreason to let a small group of puritanical zealots smash the one \nindustry that smokers can count on to quit into little bits. After all, \nyou don’t use a sledge hammer to put in a thumb tack. If anything, the \ne-cig industry has been looking for regulation, <em><strong>but you have to understand vaping is NOT smoking</strong></em>. You can’t just apply the same laws that are applied to cigarettes.</p>\n<p>So, stand up and say something. The following is a message I received\n from Mt. Baker Vapor, my supplier of vaping products. What the CTFK is \ndoing is fine, but e-cigarette juice is not tobacco and analog \ncigarettes have around 7,000 chemicals (which is 6998 more than in \ne-juice). There is no comparison, and vaping actually helps people \nactually quit smoking. Sure, nicotine isn’t great, but neither is \ncaffeine, and yet Americans drink tonnes of the stuff every day.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a customer of ours, we try not to overburden you with \nmessages, but we have been making a concerted effort to try and help \ninform our consumers around the nation about important government \ndevelopments that threaten your ability to use electronic cigarettes and\n other vapor products.</p>\n<p>Today, longtime vaping opponent, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids \n(CTFK) has assembled a call to action to urge President Obama to \npressure the FDA to finalize their Tobacco Deeming Regulations. What has\n been failed to be mentioned is that if these regulations go into \naction, 99.9% of vapor products currently on the market <strong>will be gone within two to four years. </strong>These proposed regulations will have a crippling impact on businesses and consumers.</p>\n<p>If you have not already done so, <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20160811083011/http://blog.casaa.org/2015/10/national-call-to-action-tell-white.html\" target=\"_blank\">we urge you to please send an email to your Congressional representative and Senators and ask them to support and co-sponsor <strong>HR 2058</strong></a>, a bill that will stop the FDA from banning 99% of all vapor products.</p>\n<p><em>The link [above] will take you to the CASAA blog</em> where you \nwill find all the information you need to contact the White House and \nlet your voice be heard. Together we can show that the American people \nDO NOT support these regulations.</p>\n<p>This only takes about 30 seconds and it’s the best resource we have \nfor influencing the national conversation on vaping legislation. Please \nconsider taking the time to send this important message!</p>\n<p>Please be courteous and respectful at all times during your message. \nAsk that your representative support HR 2058 and be sure to share how \nvaping has made a positive impact on your life.</p>\n<p><strong>THANK YOU!</strong></p>\n<p>Thank you for your willingness to weigh in. It’s important for all \nadult consumers of electronic cigarettes and vapor products to help \neducate policymakers about vaping.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Mt. Baker people are just trying run a business, provide a \nquality, American-made product, give great customer service, and all at \nthe best prices around. And, no. They didn’t ask me to do this. I know a\n few dozen people who quit smoking through vaping. I’ve helped a few \ninto it. I see thousands online, and I know that there are tens of \nthousands more whom I do not know, all who have used vaping to stop \nsmoking. That’s a potential of hundreds of thousands of people who will \nno longer be murdered by the tobacco industry just for using their \nproducts.</p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>Granted, I'm not entirely in love with the first season of Amazon's highly anticipated Clarkson, Hammond, and May vehicle (that's a pun), The Grand Tour, but it needs to breathe (that's a wine reference) somewhat before it starts to shine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/entertainment/a31910/how-to-fix-the-grand-tour/?src=nl&amp;mag=rdt&amp;list=nl_rdt_news&amp;date=121416\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/entertainment/a31910/how-to-fix-the-grand-tour/?src=nl&amp;mag=rdt&amp;list=nl_rdt_news&amp;date=121416\">In the latest R&amp;T op/ed from Jack Baruth</a>, the Avoidable Contact scribe rants about the failings he perceives are being perpetrated by The Grand Tour team, and he is right on some accounts. It does feel overly scripted, for the most part, and the best thing about Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May is their <i>repartee en flagrante</i>. We don't quite get to see it just yet, but it's more complicated than just getting the trio back in front of the cameras again. <br></p>\n<p>We need recall that the BBC fired Clarkson for bitch slapping a production assistant. Clarkson walked and so did his fellow presenters. When he was courted by Amazon, show runner Andy Wilman and much of the Top Gear production team followed. The problem isn't that these people don't know how to work together, it's that the book they took 23 series (we call them seasons) over 18 years to write had to be tossed into the fire. You don't think the BBC would just let Clarkson and Co. walk off with the Top Gear formula, did you? Top Gear has been one of the BBC's biggest international golden gooses ever.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"667\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ph42MtckwYU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Episode #2 from the first series back in 2002. Look at how empty the hanger was!<br></p>\n<p>Production needed to be different or the BBC would sue the hell out of Amazon. So, not unlike trying to get a cruise ship to do a backflip (both impossible and an impressively epic visual metaphor), the well-oiled Top Gear machine, honed over two decades starting with the almost utterly unwatchable first season, was going to have to start mostly from scratch. This is what we're seeing now. They had to do it to learn what was and was not going to work, and they need the crucible of public opinion to craft all new material. <br></p>We've also seen how hard it is to replicate Top Gear. The Australian version was cancelled after four years. The Russian version was cancelled half way through the first season. The US version has run for five seasons, but has never drawn significant viewership and is widely derided. There are South Korean, Chinese, and French versions as well, but I can't tell how well they're doing, though the French version posted a record viewership for the first episode. <br><br>It's not easy because good television is hard. So, let's give The Grand Tour and Amazon some room to get it right. It's fun to watch already, and the hosts and Andy Wilman will start to dial things in after this season. Like a fine wine, they just need room to breathe. <br>\n</div>\n",

Apple has simply lost the thread of late and Microsoft is the real innovator these days. For the record, Windows 10 is the bomb and is far more functional than Mac OS X. Regardless of my enthusiasm, however, my wife Rima still insists on using her dumb ass iPhone 5s and it's admittedly sweet 8MP camera. She takes a lot of images, and that takes up a lot of room. She needed to archive the images she had taken and make room for a few thousand more. </p>\n<p>But, ahem... iOS only lets you delete images one at a time, or a bunch, but you have to select them manually. One. at. a. time. How annoying, and terrible UI/UX design. Jesus, Apple, I thought you guys were supposed to be awesome at this. </p>\n<p>Enough with the griping. Found out a simple-ish way to backup and delete all of your images. YMMV, since I only did this on an iPhone 5s with recent-ish software on it. You will need: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>A PC with Windows (since I have no idea how a Mac will respond, and frankly don't care). </li>\n<li>Your iPhone.</li>\n<li>The USB cable. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's likely you'll also need to have the iTunes software installed so you have the mobile device drivers for your iPhone, or this probably won't work. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fire up the PC.</li>\n<li>Fire up iTunes (maybe, maybe not). </li>\n<li>Plug in your iPhone.</li>\n<li>Open up Windows Explorer.</li>\n<li>Go to My Computer or, if you aren't living under a rock, Computer.</li>\n<li>Open up the iPhone drive that should be there. </li>\n<li>Open the DCIM folder in there. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, at this point, you should see a few folders that have stupid names. These are the different folders you have on your iPhone in the Photos app. You can't delete these. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Now, open each dumb folder. </li>\n<li>Select all. </li>\n<li>Press Delete. </li>\n<li>Watch them all go away. </li>\n<li>Lather, rinse, repeat.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, I suggest you copy these to your hard drive before deleting them, or you can MOVE them, which is kind of the same. If you don't, you'll lose every last one of them. In case you don't know, when deleting files from a connected drive, there is no Recycle Bin. It just goes away.</p>\n<p>Poof. </p>\n<p>So, take your time, be careful. Use checklists if you have to. Mind your surroundings. Keep your guard up. </p>\n</div>\n",

The simple answer, and this is a guess, is that HP sees three things. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Windows 10 development is reportedly significantly easier than for 8/8.1. That should induce some developers to prep versions that run on all Windows 10 systems.</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2016/02/25/microsoft-project-astoria-dead/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: http://www.engadget.com/2016/02/25/microsoft-project-astoria-dead/\">Microsoft may have dumped Project Astoria</a>, a dev kit to help Android app devs port to Windows 10, but <a href=\"https://dev.windows.com/en-us/bridges/ios\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https://dev.windows.com/en-us/bridges/ios\">Project Islandwood, a similar dev kit for iOS apps</a>, is still on the workbench, and the iOS app ecosystem is significantly more cultured than Google's.</li>\n<li>HP has a <i>very old relationship</i> with corporate culture. HP can see the writing on the wall, and it's screaming CONVERGENCE = LOWER COSTS. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>It should come as any surprise that companies would prefer to adopt an ecosystem that gives them the most control, the most integration, and the most efficient workforce for the lowest possible outlay. That's exactly what the HP Elite X3 is all about, and HP sees the potential quite clearly. They don't even care if they sell fewer traditional enterprise-grade desktops. Those are loss leaders. If they can get in on the ground floor, nay, BE the ground floor of this hot new segment, they can cement their dominance and exert control over the formation of the new segment. </p>\n<p>Word from MWC last week was that an Elite X3 kit with optional laptop \"dumb terminal\" will cost much less than a smartphone and laptop, and the buyer gets both in one purchase. The dock comes with the handset, so just add a Monitor/Keyboard/Mouse combo kit for a few hundred more and you've completely outfitted one employee at a lower cost, reduced the time IT works on that employee significantly, cut down on the potential for shadow IT, and don't have to adopt any kind of lame BYOD policy. Sure, some people will complain, but I'm sure they'll pick their paycheck over their smartphone. </p>\n<p>For the coup de grâce (if you think I'm misspelling it, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_de_gr%C3%A2ce\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_de_gr%C3%A2ce\">look it up</a>), HP has developed Workspace, something of an app store for virtualized desktop applications to run over a network to the device, though real details aren't yet available. I do know that HP Workspace requires a subscription fee, so it's unlikely that any consumers who are able to get a hold of one of these magnificent* devices will be able to afford to use it. All that will remain to be seen later this year when HP starts rolling them out. </p>\n<p>* early reports from presser hands-on periods have suggested it's marvelous, but time always tells the truth when it comes to smartphones. </p>\n</div>\n",

I earn almost nothing since I can't get work. I get little gigs here and there, but most people just ignore me. It doesn't matter how often I apply for work or what kind. I almost never hear back, and when I do, they find out I'm 47 with 20 years of experience and they ditch me then. So, it wasn't a big surprise to find out from our former neighbors that our condo wasn't sold, they were renting it out to someone else for more money. </p>\n<p>        </p>\n<div class=\"posthaven-gallery\" id=\"posthaven_gallery[1029912]\">\n                  <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1664821/d7R6B7xxPG6a9Vaz7eKYUZutxp8/TYLERTABLET_-_WIN_20150129_141105.JPG\">\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1664822/vX1hSAPsG0dlisFHj7cFnlA8ko0/TYLERTABLET_-_WIN_20150129_141145.JPG\">\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1664823/mq5-ULErIXn994Q5nBM_yOmODV4/TYLERTABLET_-_WIN_20150129_141300.JPG\">\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1664824/9K_O_QY3rWSHtGo8Zm2-BUVqgeY/TYLERTABLET_-_WIN_20150129_141312.JPG\">\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1664825/ue3W-7GUDfL0IZ4Ur9TSRf9GKyM/TYLERTABLET_-_WIN_20150129_141318.JPG\">\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1664826/sD2k70DN4stxtAVSMe5O7n6BUqU/TYLERTABLET_-_WIN_20150129_145634.JPG\">\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1664827/3iMBrD7FkFZrH2EWCMbqwY5eKyk/TYLERTABLET_-_WIN_20150129_145642.JPG\">\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1664828/R4QgPVnOQIsK_ENr6crEpHdVBew/TYLERTABLET_-_WIN_20150129_145651.JPG\">\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1664829/9PDBu3-w88yB_hany4-1Gek958M/TYLERTABLET_-_WIN_20150129_145652.JPG\">\n        </p>\n\n        </div>\n<p>They lied to us so we would leave easier. Capitalism at work. </p>\n<p>So we moved into a new place near the mall. $400 more a month, pretty much most of our monthly income, but it was all we could find, and I did just finish the book. The advance helped get us in, but we'd need more to stay. Then we find out the complex had been sold to another management outfit (I am not kidding, it used to be The Promenade). When we were late with the rent, there was no leniency. There was no talking. We had X number of days to pay and X number of dollars fine to pay, and we didn't make it. My publisher simply would not move any faster, and my check was a few months late to save us. The evicted us just like that. </p>\n<p>Step two as part of a downward spiral is to move into a hotel, but not just any hotel. It has to be a hotel with kitchens in the rooms, so the rate is just that much higher. The kitchen is critical because the daughter cannot eat outside food. She has severe allergies, and I mean severe. She also has special dietary needs due to her Epilepsy. And then there's the Autism. Yes, she was dealt a very poor hand in the poker game of life, but we manage. Now, however, we move to the montage portion of the story to get through about a year of crap quickly. </p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The parents are involved. This is hideously humiliating when you're in the ballpark of 50 years old. It's even more humiliating when your father treats you like you're still 18 and your step monster treats you like a convicted felon. For the record, I'm not. I end up not getting what I need to save my family, so I am doomed to going back and back and back until they finally move and don't tell me where. They moved because they are old and need a smaller place, not because of me, but that didn't stop them from using it to get me off their backs. The other father lives in another country and is a raging asshole. </p>\n<p>We hit upon a plan to buy a used RV. I thoroughly research to find it's hard, but doable, and by doable, I mean requires regular maintenance, but makes our total costs per month about $1,800. We try to coordinate family and friends and others, and they come through for about $5,000, then the unbelievable happens. I find a sweet deal on Craig's List and it turns out too good to be true. It's a classic bait-and-switch scam. We're shown a really nice RV that works, and sold one that looks like it but is crap. Oh, you should have seen them as soon as I realized what they had done. They were like cats licking their chops after the kill.</p>\n<p>We managed to put together one more chance to get an RV, and we were careful, but it just wasn't in the cards. This time around, the RV that we could afford was sold out from under us because of an error in communications. Every day we're in the hotel is money out, so the window for making a deal shrinks by the moment, and there just aren't enough RVs that are cheap and in good condition. To keep our options open, I keep scouring the regular rentals, but all of them have gone up, people aren't interested in renting to us, and Craig's List is full of scams it takes hours to sort through to find the real ones. </p>\n<p>If you're thinking public support at this point, you'll likely not be surprised that it wasn't and isn't an option. We make too much. Yes, not enough to live anywhere, but too much to get help. Orange County is also out of housing vouchers. Every time I call to ask. We've been on the Section 8 waiting list for four years now, and we're at position #21,405. That's a change of roughly 4,000 positions since we got on back in 2012. I've long since used up all 99 weeks of unemployment. Now, just about two months ago, while out doing something nice (and free) for the first time in a long while, we get back to the hotel to find a notice that we're expected to move out in 60 days because we pay late. </p>\n<p>You do the math. Parents are out. Friends have all been tapped and can't give any more. Internet relations have been exhausted. Jobs are not presenting themselves. Even when they do, they don't. I've gotten a few friends popping in to see if I can do X, Y, or Z. When I can, it sounds all good, but then nothing happens. Usually after I send my CV. Following up doesn't seem to help, either. <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/saverimasfamily\" target=\"_blank\">So, we start up a GoFundMe campaign to try, as a desperate, last ditch effort, raise the funds we need to get an RV</a>, our least expensive option to have a place to live. We get some help, and it's deeply appreciated, but it's not enough. </p>\n<p>End montage.</p>\n</blockquote>Here we are, about a week or so away from having to leave the last place we can stay. There are no shelters. We have our car, but how did you feel the last time you slept in your car for one night? The only thing we have is the small revenue coming in every month and Rima's writing. She's prolific, too. I should know, I get to edit her stories. She gets read quite a bit, too, and so she promotes our GoFundMe campaign on her site. What happens? The hosting company we've been with for nearly a decade suddenly develops a ridiculous series of issues. <p></p>\n<p>Our sites go down 8 times in 10 days. </p>\n<p>As a result, traffic trends down, less people see the campaign, and fewer people go, meaning fewer people chip in. It's like everything we do ends up heading in the wrong direction. It can make a family gun shy, but we still keep pulling the trigger hoping that THIS time something will actually happen in our favor, and then it doesn't. If I were paranoid, I'd think that someone was out to get us. Wouldn't you? </p>\n<p>Well, that's where we're at. It's not pretty. It's not fun. It's not a party. It's mostly a daily struggle to stay sane and try to come up with something, anything to keep ourselves busy. Soon, though, it won't matter because we'll be homeless for realzies, like the On The Street kind. The kind of homelessness that treats people with medical issues and developmental disorders very poorly (as if being homeless wasn't bad enough). The kind of homelessness that prematurely ends both the promising career of a strong progressive voice for analysis and truth and the nascent talent of an artistic Autistic young woman who wants to be a Disney animator and who still managed to get herself into college nearly four years early. </p>\n<p>I don't really care what happens to me, as long as they can thrive. </p>\n<p>But it doesn't look like that's going to happen. </p>\n<p>Nice knowing you, internet. Who knows, though. Maybe THIS time it WILL work out...</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>PS: In case you thought that my book's sales should be really kicking in, you'd be wrong. It didn't sell. It was a flop. </p>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>In all honesty, I used to love HP, but not for the reasons you might think. Their enterprise and server gear has long been solid, including their desktop and laptop products. I have much experience with many years of such equipment. That changed for me a few years ago when I purchased a brand new HP ProBook 4540s. Aside from the display being of lower resolution than I wanted, the machine was a 15.6\" mid-range powerhouse. It has a 2.5GHz 3rd-gen Core i5, 8GBs of RAM, 750GB drive, all of the expected widgets for connectivity, and hybrid graphics featuring Intel HD 4000 for mundane stuff and an AMD Radeon HD 7650M with 1GB of RAM. That last item would be perfect for my gaming needs, which aren't cutting edge, but can tax integrated systems. I thought I'd found my soulmate, and at $600, a thrifty value, too. </p>\n<p>Boy, was I wrong. Just try to imagine Tom Hanks having his maniacal laughing fit in The Money Pit after discovering hidden issue after issue with what he'd hoped was his dream home. To make an already long story short, all sorts of bits went wonky, I fought with HP over repairs covered by the warranty, had to take the battle to the BBB, and won without winning. Today, I still use it. The trackpad doesn't work. There is no keyboard anymore. It works, but it's a frustrating thing to be forced to work on a $600 lemon and that it was HP that screwed me. HP fought tooth and nail to avoid doing anything to make me happy, and if that was their goal, mission accomplished. So, like any jilted suitor, I decided to shun them. </p>\n<p>For the longest time, they only released a few things that I found tempting, but I was able to. I won't even bother to list them because I can't. Hideous recall, you see. One was a tiny little blob of a compy. Overpriced. Another was a gorgeous laptop of some kind. WAY overpriced. Then today, they came out with this...</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dove_Display_Catalog_Frt_Open_with_Falcon_HR_v1_8bit-e1456010608705-980x573.jpg\" title=\"Image: http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Dove_Display_Catalog_Frt_Open_with_Falcon_HR_v1_8bit-e1456010608705-980x573.jpg\"><br></p>\n<p>Right? That little guy on the left isn't so little. It's the HP Elite X3 and it's just shy of 6 inches. There's a better picture of the front at the end of this piece, and if you already desire it (who can blame you) prepare to be disappointed. Price and release date are not yet known as HP isn't talking, but there are hints of a Summer release. Timing could very well be up to when Windows 10 Mobile is released to Gold Master. If you need additional technical deets, here are the specs from <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/02/hp-elite-x3-a-flagship-windows-phone-thats-unambiguously-enterprisey/\" target=\"_blank\">Ars Technica</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hardware-wise, the Elite x3 ticks all the boxes and then some: Quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 running at 2.15GHz, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, 5.96 inch 2560×1440 AMOLED screen with Gorilla Glass 4, 2×2 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, LTE-Advanced, 16MP rear and 8MP front cameras, both iris recognition <em>and</em> a rear-mounted fingerprint reader, microSD, USB 3 Type-C, dual SIM, a 4150mAh battery with wireless charging using both the Qi and PMA standards, and IP 67 water resistance (safe against immersion in 1 [meter] of water for 30 minutes).</p></blockquote>\n<p>And, if you can't tell by looking, it's running Windows 10 Mobile. Now, that \"laptop\" next to it isn't really a laptop. It's the modern equivalent of a dumb terminal. See, Windows 10 Mobile has a neat trick called Continuum where, with a special dock, you can run a Windows-like desktop environment while still getting to use the phone. If you already have a nice monitor, keyboard, and mouse, HP does have their own dock, too. The lappy bit would come in handy for mobile workers, though. </p>\n<p>That's exactly who HP is going after, too. Enterprise. HP already sells really well into corporate markets. Windows 10 will start to take off in those markets soon, and integration is highly prized because it can reduce costs and complexity. HP wants to be the winner for Windows shops by offering a complete, all-in-one, fully integrated Windows experience for users and administrators, a hat trick, if you will. Most data-intensive apps these days are SaaS, anyway. You don't need huge local storage, and mobile CPU capabilities are improving like gangbusters. My Dell Venue 8 Pro runs Windows 10 better on a dual-core Atom with 2GBs of RAM than my laptop does with a quad-core Core i5 and 8GBs. It's not bad with games, either (just not Team Fortress 2, my one and only love). </p>\n<p>So, I'm faced with a quandary. Do I unreasonably sustain my harmful grudge of HP for dissing me and being unapologetic for said diss, or do I just let that anger and resentment go free to sulk in its own dark, gloomy corner so that I might readily accept the entire Elite X3 product lineup into my heart? I'm inclined to think that yes, I should let it go and just move on. </p>\n<p>It's just that HP hurt me really bad, and right where I live; my writing. </p>\n<p>I find it difficult to allow the superficial promise of something glossy and new override my ethical, if emotional, position. Then again, it is really nice looking and it's just a gadget. So, HP, if you're reading this, you can apologize by sending me one, with all of the accessories, of course. </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/HP-Elite-x3-front-facing-980x980.jpg\"><br></p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>Water is the single most important component for life on Earth. 70% of the human body is made of water. If you place your ear against a person who is jumping up and down, you might even be able to hear some of that water sloshing about. Isn't science fascinating? In order to live, a human must drink at least two gallons of what every day. Fortunately, American scientists armed with this knowledge were able to invent one of the most important devices we have in today's society. </p>\n<p>The water fountain. </p>\n<p>Imagine, if you will, being able to walk up to a box, push a button, and receive a refreshing, life giving stream of clean, clear water directly into your mouth! I know it seems insane, but I can assure you that the water fountain is indeed real. Studies have determined that the average human will encounter at least a dozen water fountains during their lifetime. This is testimony to the fact that American science has made a truly great achievement through the installation of water fountains all over the United States of America. If you see one, do not pass on your chance to experience a water fountain. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Now, if it wasn't enough to simply press a button to get water directed into your mouth, a true scientific milestone in its own right, try to embrace the concept of the electric water fountain. Don't worry. You won't shock yourself to death. The electricity, through the magic of science, keeps the water chilled, making already fresh water even more delicious!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here are some tips and tricks you should keep in mind when visiting a water fountain: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water fountains come in all shapes and sizes. When in a public area you are unfamiliar with, try pushing, pulling, and tugging on anything that might look like a handle or button, and you're sure to find one of the many cleverly hidden water fountains those playful American scientists had installed</li>\n<li>Water is a precious commodity, so be sure to place your face as close to the Tubular Water Emitter as possible so as to avoid waste.*</li>\n<li>It's important to note the difference between a spigot and a water fountain. Spigots have knobs to turn on the water flow, water fountains have buttons, and sometimes unicorns. </li>\n<li>If you see someone acting suspiciously around a water fountain, be sure to contact the police, as they will want to make sure there are no villains around licking the splash guards of water fountains. </li>\n<li>Don't lick the splash guards on water fountains, at least not without permission from your local police or city mayor. </li>\n<li>Try to keep the time you spend using a water fountain to under 10 minutes so as to allow others the joy of using a public water fountain. </li>\n<li>If you are rich, consider installing water fountains in your home and around your property, so you can share fresh water with the proletariat. Trust us when we say that you will be heartily thanked for your consideration. </li>\n<li>We'd prefer not to say this, but recent actions have forced our hand. DO NOT pee in the smaller water fountains. Yes, they do resemble urinals, but they are not urinals. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>* A principle rule of thumb is that the pressure of the output at the emitter is defined by the average height of the people who use it. In other words, if the stream arcs water over your head, it is meant for tall people. This doesn't mean you are forbidden to use it, just do so with caution. </p>\n<p>There is little like the pure and simple joy one derives from the experiences that can be had when engaging with a public water fountain. Be respectful, wait your turn in line, don't leave anything behind, and if you have a fire pit, don't forget to stir the coals.</p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>Congratulations! You've discovered vertical transportation through the miracle of the Elevator!! Elevators carry 3.82 <i>billion</i> people over 82.3 <i>quadrillion</i> vertical miles every single day. Elevators are one of the single most popular modes of transportation on the planet. Now that it's the first time you've been in a elevator, you should take a moment to savor that landmark you have achieved. </p>\n<p>After some self-congratulatory back patting, however, it's time to understand your role in the Elevator. The following are some tips that will help you become acclimated to life in Elevators. Pay close attention to prevent anyone from becoming injured, or even killed. Who knows... The life you save may be your own. </p>\n<p>Please memorize these important tips:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Be aware that you will be given very little time to make adjustments or decisions. It's best to act as impulsively as possible when engaging an Elevator. </li>\n<li>After the doors have opened, quickly move inside and stake your claim. If this is your first Elevator, look to the left and right of the doors from the inside. On one or both sides, you will find the Elevator control panel. Do NOT panic.*</li>\n<li>Once the Elevator begins to move, you are free to move about the Elevator, just don't go to far. You might miss your floor!</li>\n<li>Elevators make a noise to indicate when it has arrived at a floor. Please keep your screaming and/or loud horseplay to a minimum so the other passengers can hear the indicator sound. </li>\n<li>Some Elevators use flimsy glass for the outside walls instead of bullet-proof steel plating. Make sure to keep your profile towards the glass or carry a shield for extra protection from snipers. </li>\n<li>Some Elevators that use flimsy glass are located in upscale regions where sniper fire is not common. In these cases, make sure to keep your hands on the glass to steady yourself as the Elevator moves. </li>\n<li>In case of an emergency which does not result in your Elevator falling hundreds of feet to reduce all passengers to a sticky, wet mess, you will find an escape hatch in the ceiling. Before opening the hatch all the way, be sure to check for trip wires or feral rodents.</li>\n<li>On the rare occasions you find yourself feeling confined or are prone to fits of claustrophobia, position yourself near the door and face the back of the Elevator. This signals your fellow passengers to respectfully back away to give you some room to clear your head. Be sure to smile broadly and give a thumbs up to show your appreciation. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><i>* While you may think the Elevator a space craft or amazing machine from the future, the Elevator is well grounded in complex scientific theory. At no time should you ever try to reprogram an Elevator.</i> </p>\n<p>Once you start taking trips via Elevator, be sure to follow all the rules of etiquette and decorum and you'll do just fine. Also, remember to feel comfortable. Feel free to talk on a mobile phone or chat with your fellow passengers about their potential destination. People often feel tense while traveling, and a friendly face can help ease their anxiety.</p>\n<p>Before you know it, you'll be an Elevator expert!</p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>It's amazing the number of things that are yellow in color that are unappealing. Lemonade is pretty great, but I wouldn't say it's a best thing in life. It's not even that yellow and it's liquid, so there's no chance of it looking like a banana. There might be a banana-shaped drink pitcher or beer mug, though. Closely related to lemonade, but produced in a completely different manner and lacking lemonade's appeal, is urine. Sure, you can pee into your radiator or write your name (poor penmanship included) in snow or even drink it if you are lost in a desert, but it's not considered a good drink. I doubt chilling it or adding sugar would improve the taste. Then again, some people go gaga over coffee beans that a cat shit out. </p>\n<p>When I was still a kid and living in Knoxville, I went to summer camp in Virginia. We had a huge lake with a diving tower and about a dozen sailboats of all sizes. I loved sailing. I was a skilled enough sailor to be able to solo a 13 footer that was yellow and shaped like a banana. That was a best thing in life, but not because the boat was yellow. All of my best moments on that boat, tiller in hand, ducking to avoid the boom while tacking, trimming the main for speed, were all spent where I couldn't see the yellow hull. Also, people say red makes things go faster, not yellow. </p>\n<p>There are plenty of unpleasant or unfortunate things that are yellow, though. </p>\n<p>        </p>\n<div class=\"posthaven-gallery\" id=\"posthaven_gallery[1025416]\">\n                  <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1658689/pKz7ZFQ5ZF3dSBcioP-XQ-AliWI/hideous-yellow-muumuu.jpg\">\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1658690/2zQL5xzjtE0RUL1mtHNixDxwyu4/horrible-yellow-peeps.jpg\">\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1658691/Tkvq1jCZZ9TZWHF1Ue_iuumng-Q/i_hate_yellow_t_shirts-p235591263632573312caih_400.jpg\">\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1658692/Ca1O_Du4LYAm4TygeYjpW-wKuEM/man-yellow-wig.jpg\">\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1658693/v3ZNawVNehO81QP-PBckRPIWToE/terrible-yellow-hat.jpg\">\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1658694/zJJoAjAlodg5dtDqV4x-WKBsIqU/yellow-shoe.jpg\">\n        </p>\n\n        </div>\n<p>Bananas are tasty, but they are off white. Only the peel is yellow, and it tastes awful. Vomit everywhere proudly features corn for some reason. It's odd to think that there might be some mythical, unknowable beast of terror, lurking just outside of our reality, whose dastardly job it is to place corn in every pile of vomit. It's even more disturbing to find corn in your vomit when you haven't eaten any. I don't think I've seen a yellow sex toy, but then I haven't seen a lot of sex toys. Is it wrong to feel sad? </p>\n<p>Asian people are considered yellow, though I'm not sure why, but Asian people are awesome. The Japanese make anime and manga (you MUST see Erased on Crunchyroll. Search for it.), there's Thai and Chinese food, there's awesome cars and technological advances, and then the people themselves are just super cool and nice. Asian cultures are diverse, interesting, and an amazing part of this Human Race we share. Then there's sulfur, which smells really bad and can do hideous things to you, at least I think. I'm not a chemist. </p>\n<p>So, aside from wickedly cool Asian people and lemonade, yellow isn't good. Glad we could clear that up. </p>\n</div>\n",

The metaphor, obscure references, and sardonic wit. These are all hallmarks common to most pundits, and it annoys me to no end. </p>\n<p>Can we please just get to the point?!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/whats-gesture-some-double-standard?cid=sm_fb_msnbc\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/whats-gesture-some-double-standard?cid=sm_fb_msnbc\">In a piece published on the MSNBC site today, Irin Carmon discusses the hand gestures Bernie Sanders' makes while talking</a>. This is how she sums up that piece:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Male politicians can face potential minefields of their own, at least when campaigning against a woman. In 2000, when Clinton ran for Senate in New York, the image of her male opponent crossing the stage during a debate and wagging his finger in her face, demanding she sign a campaign finance pledge, came to define the race. The gesture, which many saw as sexist, or as one of Clinton’s aides put it at the time, “menacing,” was credited with helping her win by 12 points. </p>\n<p>There have been no such moments so far in the Democratic primary debates, as Clinton runs for president for a second time. Sanders has been careful to express his respect for the former secretary of state and to keep it professional and largely amiable. He’s also kept on his side of the stage. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unless you're a political junkie and/or live in the State of New York, you might not recall this event. <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/03/hillary-clinton-rick-lazio-2000-senate-sexism\" target=\"_blank\">Back in 2000, when HRC was running for the open Senate seat in New York</a>, her opponent, Rick Lazio, left his podium, walked across the stage, handed her a piece of paper, and wagged his hand. Hillary went on to beat Rick by 12 points because the HRC campaign machine pushed out the clip repeatedly, suggesting that Lazio was being menacing and that the act was sexist in nature. I don't disagree. It was a terrible mistake to make on Lazio's part, and he paid the price for it. </p>\n<p>Now, read Carmon's conclusion again. She states a known fact, that Sanders has been respectful of Clinton, and then references the Lazio event. From 2000. From a state Senate debate. Aired on C-Span. So, why not state clearly that Sanders hasn't been threatening, tried to get her to sign some dumb pledge, or wagged his finger in her face?</p>\n<p>Ego.</p>\n<p>You've been educated. You did 4-7 years in college for just a degree or stuck around to get your Masters. You've penned a dissertation or two. You've been working as a journalist, analyst, and/or pundit for years. You are recognized as an expert in your field. Now you get called to go on MSNBC or Fox News or CNN once, twice, a dozen times. You have arrived. You are a nationally recognized leader in your field. </p>\n<p>So, rather than face the difficulty of determining the awareness level of your audience, you just crank up the academia, pound in the complex terms, leverage your most obscure references, and lay down some deftly complicated metaphors and hope that your readers are up to the challenge. What you won't do, however, is just say what you mean.</p>\n<p>This might surprise you, but being clear and excising complexity from your prose is not condescending. You won't talk down to your readers. They won't feel like you've abandoned your educational and professional background. To the contrary, they might just thank you. Life is difficult enough to deal with. We don't need Dianetics-grade journalism that requires a dictionary to read.* </p>\n<p>Now, it's clear that Carmon's piece isn't anywhere near the L. Ron meter, much less high on it, but she remains unclear about what she's saying, all the way to the end. It's an opinion piece! You CAN make clear the points you want to get across. There aren't any rules, but that's the POINT of an opinion piece; share your opinion! Don't make people work hard for it. </p>\n<p>The last thing we need in America now, at a time when class division is at an all-time high, the filters have been yanked off and tossed away, and both major political parties are embroiled in their own version of a civil war, is for our news outlets and primary voices to be unclear. We need to speak clearly, make our points crystal clear, and cut it out with the silly bits that fly over most people's heads. </p>\n<p><i>* my own obscure reference to L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics book which was famously difficult to read without an Oxford dictionary that I explain here because it's the nice thing to do. Not everyone recalls this. </i></p>\n</div>\n",

The various types of media I consume are just different methods of telling stories. I love books and music and anime and comics and movies and television, but more specifically what I really love is a good story. </p>\n<p>NBC's Grimm is a good story.</p>\n<p>        </p>\n<div class=\"posthaven-gallery\" id=\"posthaven_gallery[1024429]\">\n                  <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1657240/OBQcs_JRcjnA2qDzfKB5q7_IuUw/grimm8.jpg\">\n        </p>\n\n        </div>\n<p>In a nutshell, Grimm is a supernatural crime drama that is based on the simple premise that all of the monsters of worldwide myth are real and living among us. In the first seasons, Nick Burkhardt discovers from his aunt that he is an heir to the generations old mantle of monster hunters called Grimm. Yes, those Grimm, as in the Brothers Grimm, the real brothers who collected, wrote about, and popularized much of the folklore we know today. Cinderella is one such tale, but Grimm is not a Cinderella story. Grimm is dark, gritty, heartbreaking, funny at times, and exciting. Grimm is a really good story. </p>\n<p>Now, a Grimm is a human who can see <i>Wesen </i>(pronounced 'vesin'). Traditionally, Grimm have accepted their fate and travel wherever needed to root out and kill <i>Wesen</i>. <i>Wesen </i>are creatures who appear to be human most of the time unless they <i>Volga, </i>a kind of shape-shift. There are two kinds of <i>Volga</i>, one which only Grimm can see and one that everyone can see, which is the implied source for various folklore. <i></i><i>Wesen</i> , for the most part, live like pretty much everyone else. In the course of his police duties, Nick starts to see people as <i>Wesen</i>, but instead of killing them, he does his best to spare those who aren't harming anyone. I'll just say this isn't an easy task. </p>\n<p>Now, I'm not going to detail out summaries of each season. You'll just need to watch. As the seasons pass, Nick is joined by more and more people and many secrets are discovered, and later revealed. Grimm isn't just a Monster-of-the-Week series, it is a deeply complex tale with a number of interconnected story arcs and a bewildering array of <i>Wesen</i>, all portrayed by an excellent cast of characters. This isn't your average Good vs. Evil show and, while some of the drama can be quite soap opera-like, it does draw you in and make it easy to understand the motivations and emotions of the diverse and chaotic world of Portland, Oregon. </p>\n<p>Grimm is a really GREAT story. </p>\n<p>I just wrapped up Season 4, and it's an amazing twist machine. There were a large number of surprises in that season, and I am looking forward to getting into Season 5, which has a lot to work from. A lot of questions were answered in Season 4, but new questions were raised, and some goals weren't met. </p>\n</div>\n",

When I breath out, I can see the vapor. It's cold, but I can't feel it. I touch my left forefinger to my right arm and I can feel the hairs rise to meet the fingertip. I think that means there's a slight static charge in the atmosphere. I can't wrap my mind around the idea that it can be cold enough to see my breath, but not cold enough to discomfort me. <br></p>\n<p>\"Hello,\" I call out in a normal, conversational tone. <br></p>\n<p>There is no echo, but my voice isn't tight and small. I'm in a large, open space. How large is anyone's guess. Well, my guess, at least. Nobody answers. I opt not to try louder for fear... of. I'm not sure. I dwell on that for a moment and realize that I can't think of a single thing that might threaten me. Ever. I start thinking about that point and try to establish some context, but nothing comes to mind. Eventually, it seems pointless to continue dwelling and move on. I haven't moved from the spot I found myself, so I try a tentative step. </p>\n<p>        </p>\n<div class=\"posthaven-gallery\" id=\"posthaven_gallery[1023161]\">\n                  <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1655542/kgkrZGvNXCl2U-lGMYKATnvuKD4/my_deepest_darkness_by_meemzzz.jpg\">\n        </p>\n\n        </div>\n<p>I can see the dark shape of my left leg move into my vision ahead of me, and... I find ground where I expect it. It occurs to me that I might run into something, so I raise my arms. I take another step, reaching for the ground with my toes, then put my foot down. The ground is flat and feels smooth, but I don't slip. It is neither warm nor cold. It just... is. </p>\n<p>I notice, as I take each step, that there is a little more light. I can see myself more and more, but there remains nothing around me. Nothing. Just darkness above, ground below, and emptiness stretching out, well, everywhere. So far, I've been walking in a straight line from where I...</p>\n<p>Where I what? </p>\n<p>I didn't wake up. I wasn't laying down. </p>\n<p>Began? </p>\n<p>I think for a moment, and decide on a plan. I hold my left arm directly out to my side. Keeping my arm as straight as possible, I turn to face my hand. I do this again one more time. As far as I can tell, I am now facing the opposite direction, looking back at where I began. It is light enough to see the ground, so I walk back a dozen steps. The light again increases instead of decreasing. </p>\n<p>I deduce that motion of any kind increases light. That's a kind of progress, I suppose. Since I had started walking in the direction I \"began\", I turn around again using my arm trick, and start walking.</p>\n<p>At some point, it seems like the light reaches what would be it's brightest. There is nothing around. There is nothing to see. I don't know how long I have been walking, but I'm not tired. Then something new occurs to me. I stop. </p>\n<p>I look down at myself. For the first time I realize I'm not wearing anything. I examine myself carefully. I am mostly smooth all over, but have small patches of hair in variable quantities in various places. My chest is smooth and flat all the way to my penis. I have a tightly trim head of hair and a smooth face. I have five toes on each foot and five fingers on each hand. I run my hands over every inch of my body, more carefully over the places I cannot see, and find nothing. </p>\n<p>I... am just me. </p>\n<p>I sit. </p>\n<p>\"Hello,\" I ask nothing again. </p>\n<p>There is again no response, and the same effect lacking echo. My voice travels as I do, nowhere. So, I sit there, cross my legs, close my eyes, and try to think of everything I can. </p>\n<p>Nothing. </p>\n<p>All I know is what is here and, now, myself. </p>\n<p>Well, no. I think. There is one other thing. </p>\n<p>The ground. </p>\n<p>I look down at the ground and try seeing it for the first time. It looks like, well, ground. Maybe closer? I roll over on my stomach and get my face really close to the ground to get a better look. My nose is almost touching. The ambient light is so uniform that it's hard to see if there is any detail, so I rub the surface and it feels like there is a texture. I scratch at it with a fingernail and it catches an edge, then another and another. I scratch the other way and it's perfectly smooth. </p>\n<p>There are grooves in the floor. </p>\n<p>I use a fingernail to find a groove and follow it to discover it's straight, at least for a few feet. This is new, so I sit to think about it, again. There is only the ground and the light and me and since I'm naked and have nothing else I can only move or stand still so my only options are to choose which way and since there is no other way to choose based on the environment and what I know I can only base my decision on the present information which is to go with the grooves or against them. </p>\n<p>I try to think of a way to select one or the other, and find that there is no information about either. It is merely one or the other. There are no qualifiers. Neither appears to be better than the other. They just are. </p>\n<p>Or not. </p>\n<p>If I scratch my nails against the grooves, they catch and stutter. It's not smooth or easy. If I scratch with the grooves, it's smooth and offers no resistance. If there is nothing else here to gauge this... place... then do I want things to be smooth or rough. Left without much choice, there is only one thing to do. </p>\n<p>Both. </p>\n<p>I stand up, squat down, and scratch to determine the rough way, and start walking. Almost immediately, the light starts to dim, and quickly. Now, that's a reaction to my behavior, if there ever was one. I squat again, find smooth, and start walking that way. The light increases again, so I keep going. I walk and walk. I keep walking and the light remains steady. Nothing changes, unless I walk against the grooves, then the light dims. I test this a few times to make sure it happens every time. It does. </p>\n<p>It seems I've reached the crux of another problem to solve. </p>\n<p>I have no idea how long I've been at this. If I walk with the grooves, the light remains steady. There are no objects to observe. There is no way to judge that anything has occurred at all... </p>\n<p>...except me. My body. </p>\n<p>I start walking again, but this time I start counting my steps out loud. </p>\n<p>1... 2... 3... 4... and so on. Nothing changes until I reach 256 steps. </p>\n<p>One dark spot appears in front of me, but I can't tell how far. I can't touch it if I reach out, so it's not close or it may be a few steps away. With my arm extended to reach the spot, I start walking and counting again.</p>\n<p>257... 258... 259... 260... and so on, again. The spot does not change, so I lower my arm and keep walking and counting. Nothing changes until I reach 512 steps, and the dark spot turns into a small square. It becomes clear that the further I walk, the larger the spot gets.</p>\n<p>I start to run and counting in my head. </p>\n<p>At 640 steps, the square gets larger, and again at 768, and yet again at 1,024. I can see now that I am getting closer to it. The square has a black border, a white interior, and shapes inside, but I am still too far away to make out any more details. I run faster. </p>\n<p>2,048, 4,096, bigger and closer. </p>\n<p>8,192. </p>\n<p>I run into the square and the impact knocks me to the ground. I collect myself and look up at the square. It floats above the ground, and has words inside of it. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To Continue, Tap OK.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Below those words is a smaller square with the letters \"OK\" inside. </p>\n<p>I step back to get a better look. It looks no different, but I realize I now have a landmark that is associated with the grooves in the ground. I walk to the left of the square, against the grooves, and the light remains steady. It seems that I have gotten around that limitation. I walk to the side of the square and it almost disappears, but I can see the back. The Square, then, is perfectly flat. I move around the back and see that it is plain white. I continue around the other side and come around to the front again. The square is unchanged. I turn and start walking away. The light almost goes out completely, so I take a step back and turn around. The light returns.</p>\n<p>Well, that didn't work, I think to myself. </p>\n<p>Facing the square, I started backing away from the square. After 16 steps, the light starts to dim slowly. 32 steps away and it's darker still, but I can still see the square. I decide that the square is my next point of focus and return to standing in front of it. Again, I read the words, this time out loud. </p>\n<p>\"To continue, tap ok.\" </p>\n<p>I look around. Nothing happens. </p>\n<p>So, what does it want, I say in my head. The word \"TO\" is a preposition and, in conjunction with the word \"CONTINUE\", it states that I need to do something to move past this point. The word \"OK\" also appears in a small box below, but I am unsure of what the word \"TAP\" means. \"TAP\" is clearly a direction, but what it is I do not know, so I sit to think out the problem. </p>\n<p>I am here and there is nothing but myself, the ground, and this square and it want's me to move on but I don't know what tap means and since it implies the concept of a tool to \"TAP\" the \"OK\" the problem lies in the fact that I have no tools so I must be the tool and something that I do to the \"OK\" will result in completing the task. </p>\n<p>I stand up and reach out with the one tool I do have, my hand, and press it against the \"OK\" square. </p>\n<p>The square disappears. </p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>\"Wow,\" Derek exclaimed loudly. \"Seventeen minutes, forty four seconds for ALPHA616, Jerry.\"</p>\n<p>What was presumably Jerry's head popped out from behind a large computer display. </p>\n<p>\"Whoa,\" he said in surprise,\" is that even possible?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm looking at the IO data right now. It's already done it, and it figured out everything,\" enthused Derek, a huge grin on his face. </p>\n<p>Jerry walked over and leaned over Derek's shoulder to look at the monitor. In the corner was a small view of the running program showing ALPHA616 looking around now that the dialog box had disappeared. Other windows show lots of indecipherable data and program code, but there is one that shows the results of this most recent iteration of the program. It appeared to be a list and each one had a green check mark next to them. </p>\n<p>\"We need to get Dr. Farber in here now,\" said Jerry, his tone suddenly serious. </p>\n<p>\"Oh, hell yeah,\" Derek barked, clapping his hands. </p>\n<p>\"It's clear from this initial data that this particular instantiation of the AI core has passed the first test.\" </p>\n</div>\n",

Marvel is a hugely dominating force in film these days, but the real core audience for science fiction used to be found on the small screen. Science fiction fans demand longer, more complex stories, deeper character development, and to have their thoughts poked. </span><i>Star Trek</i><span> is most commonly trotted out as prime exemplar. </span><br></p>\n<p>Aside from the original series which was ended prematurely, there have been five other series, the animated one most people don't recall, three huge series with seven year runs, and one aborted attempt at going back in time that ran for only four seasons. If you look beyond Trek, however, you see that TV used to be riddled with all manner of scifi shows. <i>Space 1999, Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, The Wild, Wild West</i> (one of my personal faves that started in Black &amp; White), and more recently <i>Futurama, Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, Andromeda</i>, the much loved <i>Quantum Leap</i>, the even more loved <i>Firefly</i>, <i>Sliders</i>, the amazing run of <i>Dr. Who, Babylon 5</i>, and that magnum opus, the new <i>Battlestar Gallactica</i>. </p>\n<p>Then something happened, and science fiction seemed to become less important to TV producers. Sure, there were the periodic stabs at it, but TV became a police drama/reality show wasteland. Even SyFy, that staunch stalwart of science fiction, wasn't producing as many series as it was running more horror-based content and live action shows that just weren't interesting. </p>\n<p>But then things started to pick up. </p>\n<p>A few years ago we got the phenomenally quirky and dark <i>Orphan Black</i>, the very dark re-imagining of the classic <i>The Twilight Zone</i> called <i>Black Mirror</i>, the look at the what it means to be good that is <i>Dark Matter</i>, and the perfectly cast <i>Killjoys</i>. These are all really good science fiction shows, but each of them lack something; that one thing that would make them great. Like <i>The Expanse</i>. </p>\n<p>I'll let the Wikipedia entry explain the plot, or at least as much as you're going to get: </p>\n<blockquote><p><i><b>Two hundred years in the future, in a fully colonized Solar System, police detective Josephus Miller (</b></i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jane\"><i><b>Thomas Jane</b></i></a><i><b>), born in the </b></i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt\"><i><b>asteroid belt</b></i></a><i><b>, is given the assignment to find a missing young woman, Julie Mao (</b></i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Faivre\"><i><b>Florence Faivre</b></i></a><i><b>). Meanwhile, James Holden (</b></i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Strait\"><i><b>Steven Strait</b></i></a><i><b>), the Executive Officer of the ice trawler Canterbury, is involved in a tragic incident that threatens to destabilize Earth, Mars and the Belt. Far away from their struggles in space, Chrisjen Avasarala (</b></i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohreh_Aghdashloo\"><i><b>Shohreh Aghdashloo</b></i></a><i><b>), a United Nations executive, works to prevent war between Earth and Mars by any means necessary. Soon, the three find out that the missing woman and the ice trawler's fate are part of a vast conspiracy that threatens all humanity.</b></i></p></blockquote>\n<p>Watch in the opening moments of the first episode when you see Julie Mao's hair floating as if in real zero gravity (you'll find out who she is later). If you think they blew their budget on some sweet effects simply to make the first episode more compelling, you will be pleasantly surprised. From a purely pragmatic standpoint, the set work and effects are mostly top notch. Much of what you see in the series would find itself more at home in movie theaters, not TV screens. </p>\n<p>The series is tight, unpleasant, unforgiving, brutal, and shatters your calm as you watch. It is as distressing and engaging to watch as mobster dramas. The violence, the language, the abidingly deep lack of care for human life rips at your soul. You want them all to go back home, knowing in the end that they can never step foot on Earth again, more likely to die in the vacuum of space or at the hands of killers. The glaring eye of the camera gazes unflinchingly at the characters on screen as their animal urge to survive at any cost is tested again and again. Death is around every corner. </p>\n<p>The Expanse is not Star Trek. It's not Star Wars or Dune or even the more recent iteration of Battlestar Galactica. There are no heroes or angels. There are no good guys and everyone has the spark of badness in their darkened souls. This is a dirty, hurt, and torn Solar System, touched and corrupted by the corrosive hands of mankind. </p>\n<p>Welcome to The Expanse. </p>\n</div>\n",

While it would be enormously fulfilling to me to find my words having an affect on a single, solitary conservative, I am convinced that day will not come. If I might use a regional metaphor, we are the coast of Southern California fighting against The Wedge of the Right Wing. The Pacific may be vast, but those who spend their entire days railing against positive human progress are the most entrenched of radicals. They will never be turned, but... you might find this amazing, they don't need to turn.</p>\n<p>We simply need to vote.</p>\n<p>It doesn't matter what the issues are, who the candidates are, which side you're on, what you believe, where you are from, whether you're a veteran, were born here, or became a citizen after immigrating. It is our right, our duty, as citizens of the United States of America, to vote for our government. It is our duty to determine the path of our country and who should lead us there to make it happen. The only thing that matters is that we do it as a nation, together, regardless of ideology or where we land on the spectrum.</p>\n<p>We simply need to vote.</p>\n<p>Right now, our country is represented by a small percentage of Americans, and those interests don't necessarily reflect the interests of America as a whole. In reality, we don't even know what America wants. Little more than half of us vote to select a President, and the turnout is far smaller in the mid-terms. That means roughly 40-60% of America decides what America looks like, how criminals are treated, what happens to big corporations when they break the law, how poor people are helped, how much workers should be paid, what taxes are fair, who we go to war with, and much more. If we want those things to change...</p>\n<p>We simply need to vote.</p>\n<p>From here on out, that's all I'm going to talk about in relation to politics. I may personally support Bernie and hope and pray that our country just gives a damn about people again sometime soon, but for purposes of politics, I will remain neutral. My aim, my goal, my aspiration is to simply get people to vote. I don't care what party you align with, your politics or beliefs or associations. I just care that you go to the polls this November 8th and vote. Vote for your country. Vote for your conscience. Vote for your family and friends. Vote for a better world, whatever that might be.</p>\n<p>It only takes an hour or two every two years.</p>\n<div><br></div>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>I am a writer. </p>\n<p>This is what I do. For a living. Well, not so much lately, but it's the single most salient job I identify with. Back when I was a kid, being introduced to new stuff like Brave New World and Dune and Catcher in the Rye, I fell madly in love with the idea of becoming a writer. </p>\n<p>It didn't take long to discover that it wasn't going to be easy. </p>\n<p>In fact, it wasn't until 1996, when I was a mere 27 years old, that I started writing professionally. It was work, not something I wanted from writing. With my new wife, before our daughter was born, I edited and updated technical books for a publisher named Sybex. The imprint still exists, but the company is long gone, absorbed into another, larger publishing group. I've always like technology and was good with it, but it wasn't what I wanted to write. </p>\n<p>It wasn't science fiction. </p>\n<p>My heart sang when treated to the works of Isaac Asimov. I wanted to write about the life of mankind through the filter of a possible future. I wanted to examine artificial intelligence and fear and desire and pain and joy through the lenses of distant stars. I wanted my words, my ideas, to be cherished by someone, anyone else. </p>\n<p>Writing as a job didn't work out so much. The computer book publishing industry kinda tanked and consolidation changed things, and not for the better. It became harder and harder to secure editing work, and none of my books ideas were gaining traction. My agent wasn't very helpful, either. She didn't believe that the Blackberry was going to be worth the effort anymore or that small business owners would want to bother learning about how IT people work (I'm still working on the latter, albeit slowly). Lo and behold, Blackberry has a hit with its new Priv handset running Android. It just goes to show that it doesn't matter if you're right if you don't have enough influence. </p>\n<p>Eventually, I actually wrote a complete book, all by my lonesome; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Help-Desk-Dummies-Computers/dp/1119018986/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1454792156&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=getting+an+it+help+desk+job+for+dummies\" target=\"_blank\">Getting An IT Help Desk Job For Dummies</a>. It was published last year and hasn't done well. That said, I think it's a pretty damn good book, and I'm pretty hard on myself when it comes to self-review. Sometimes, I think back to when I was writing that book and realize that I wrote 99.8% of those 288 pages (the rest is just filler from Wiley). Those are all my words, which represent my personal experience and observations about the IT industry from 20+ years of being a consultant, engineer, and writer. It was the second book in the series, as well, and it should have been promoted better, but it wasn't. </p>\n<p>Que sera, sera, or as the kids say it today, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</p>\n<p>I don't have a unified, clerical definition about the state of the writer in America these days. I just know that I always feel as if I'm living under an enormous shadow. I am shaded by those who have come before me, and I wither. The collective accomplishment of these men and women greater than I am resilient is a terrible burden for one to carry, especially for me. Those aren't issues to talk about in public, though. Everyone's had a difficult family life in some fashion. I'll freely allow you to let your imagination go wild. </p>\n<p>So I keep slogging along. I have two books of fiction I am working on now, and I haven't touched them in months. One would be my first novel and the other is a collection of short stories I had written and writing now. I assigned myself a deadline for last year, and I missed it. It's not the same doing it to yourself as it is having a living, breathing editor huffing down your neck. </p>\n<p>So, in the meantime, I write here. I can't even write on my actual blog anymore. It feels like a time capsule of shame and failure, and it has my name plastered all over it. Maybe I will go back to writing there, but for now I'm going to do the deed here. </p>\n<p>Posthaven, indeed. LOLZ.</p>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"posthaven-post-body\">\n<p>Don't troll me, bro. I'm no Linux hater. I used Linux for years. I started with Caldera back when we didn't know that SCO was evil. Despite lacking coding skills of any kind, I hand-crafted my system from the ground up. At that time I was so tired of Windows that I ran Windows apps from a server to my desktop machine just so I could use Linux as my daily driver. </p>\n<p>Linux is a fantastic OS. It's powerful, capable, efficient, and dynamic. You can make it do anything you want, as long you A) have the nerd chops and B) you don't work a job which requires mainstream applications. There are the standard arguments, though. Linux has plenty of apps that are <i>like </i>Photoshop/Microsoft Word/whatever. Linux has peerless security. Linux is more reliable. Linux is a lot of things, and most of them are good, but it's no bed of roses. </p>\n<p></p>        <div class=\"posthaven-gallery\" id=\"posthaven_gallery[1021074]\">\n                  <p class=\"posthaven-file posthaven-file-image posthaven-file-state-processed\">\n          <img class=\"posthaven-gallery-image\" src=\"https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1652481/DKwNH4tqNEM_WnHLyQc7OOA1nE8/Linux_Wallpaper_1_1_by_technokoopa.png\">\n        </p>\n\n        </div>\n<p>Linux is also a terrible OS. It's complex, confusing, chaotic, and cryptic. If you are lucky enough to have an arrangement of chips inside your computer that are compatible with the one of hundreds of Linux distributions you selected, you might just get it installed the first time around, and forget it if you want to get it on a laptop or have a UEFI BIOS. Installing apps is also a crapshoot. Ubuntu has an app store, but it doesn't offer everything and has serious reliability issues. You might want to settle in and learn about <i>make</i> and tarballs. It's gonna be a long month. Security is fine, but it's no better than Mac OS X, which uses a similar foundation for security. Besides, security is only as hard as the user is willing to make it, and most average users don't care to be bothered. As for reliability, that gap has closed. I'm using Windows 10 preview on the Fast Ring and I rarely crash or have to restart, and Macs are legendary for their reliability. </p>\n<p>Linux just isn't the panacea the diehards would have us believe. </p>\n<p>I know that makes it sound like I'm not a fan, but I am. In fact, I've been a fan for much longer than most, and I'm not even a coder, so I don't have the skills to hack Linux into my perfect OS. Yet, despite these limitations, I learned enough to shape and mold it enough. I still check out the new releases of Ubuntu and follow Ubuntu Touch development. Whenever I see a new piece about Linux in my news feeds, I generally read it. </p>\n<p>I'd like to think that this is just a thing, if you know what I mean. The alternative is to suggest that the Open Source model just doesn't work as well as many had hoped. As disturbing as that might sound, it might be true. There are hundreds of distributions (kind of like brands, for the uninitiated) of Linux, but only a precious few can be counted among the known. Ubuntu is the one at the top of the recognition heap, and its the one most people gravitate towards. Mint is popular, as is Fedora, Red Hat's entry. These have even overshadowed their progenitors, Debian and Red Hat itself. </p>\n<p>The reason that this dynamic exists is because Ubuntu is developed with a solid ethic and on a regular schedule that can be counted on like a good, solid Timex watch. Ubuntu also rolls out their Long Term Support editions every few years, as well. The LTS is designed for business, and to sell Canonical support plans, which is where most of the revenue to make Ubuntu comes from. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this at all. It's a perfectly sensible and ethical business model, but it's important to know that there's a company behind the generosity and freedom of Ubuntu. </p>\n<p>But it doesn't matter. Canonical is a large company that makes a good amount of revenue, but they have still failed to make Ubuntu and household name or even crack significant desktop installation statistics. If that wasn't bad enough, the trends have been clearly indicating that desktop is dropping in popularity. Numbers show that most Millennials spend the bulk of their time on the internet via their phones, a primary driver of the Phablet market. Even the elderly who use smartphones will check Facebook on the small screen three out of every five times. With Linux only being represented on mobile devices by Google's abysmal Android OS, that fact doesn't lend a lot of credence to the idea that Linux is about to break through. </p>\n<p>Then there's the App Economy. Apple and Google have carved out enormous, billion dollar markets for apps in their respective markets, and people overwhelmingly find apps a more appealing way to access their increasingly internet-based apps. So much is moving to the App model and run in the Cloud that desktops are becoming a burden. I have 23 apps on my Windows 10 taskbar, 15 of which are Google Chrome \"Apps\" (meaning they just run in their own browser window). The rest are desktop apps that access online services, all except Steam, which is an online system that supports my desktop-only PC games. </p>\n<p>You can do the same thing with Linux, but then you'll be faced with all of the unknowable challenges of getting it installed, learning how to use it, figuring out how to work around the lack of tools you are used to, and even things like how to get it connected to a wireless network, which can be oddly complex, depending on which Window Manager you select. A little hint; my fave WM is Xfce, but if you are a noob, don't bother. Just go with Ubuntu or Mint Cinnamon. </p>\n<p>Once you're done, though, I think that you'll soon find that Linux really isn't a great replacement for Windows 7. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/article/why-switch-to-windows-10-or-a-mac-when-you-can-use-linux-mint-17-3-instead/\" target=\"_blank\">Take in the opposite perspective @ ZDNet</a>. </p>\n</div>\n",

True, they freak some people out, but I don't post anything hyper-creepy or pornographic*. </p>\n<p>*much</p>\n<p>So, anyway, writing. I am what I call an ordered free thought writer. I generally start with an opening sentence, and then go from there. Once I have enough material down, I re-read it and edit myself. Where I can, I add more material, rewrite for clarity or additional context, and keep writing until all of my points are clear, at least to me. </p>\n<p>On larger pieces, I abandon this approach entirely and work from an outline. I will develop a complete outline with notes until the structure of the work is clear from the initial standpoint. This is what I did with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Help-Desk-Dummies-Computers/dp/1119018986/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1454466359&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=getting+an+it+help+desk+job+for+dummies\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Link: http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Help-Desk-Dummies-Computers/dp/1119018986/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1454466359&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=getting+an+it+help+desk+job+for+dummies\">Getting An IT Help Desk Job For Dummies</a>. Even though I eventually removed a few sections and realigned things, the big framework allowed me to just fill in the holes. It also allowed me to stop working on something I wasn't in to or having trouble with, and get writing done elsewhere. </p>\n<p>It really helps me to have a clear picture of the end result when I start writing. On smaller pieces, like this very post, it's easy. Once I get over 2,500 words, though, a piece starts to need some formatting, which is where an outline can come in handy. </p>\n<p>I just use Word. It's good at outlines. </p>\n<p>Well, that's it. I wrote about me writing, which seems somewhat recursively cannibalistic. I hope my words are tasty :) </p>\n</div>\n",

When I was sort of growing up in Pasadena (long story) I spent many years listening to the then influential KROQ 106.7 FM. Back then KROQ was probably the single most powerful New Wave/Alternative station, driving much of what was getting heard back in the 80's. I was certainly tired of the pop and junk and had gotten into Progressive Rock with albums like Yes' Fragile, Jethro Tull's Aqualung, and Rush in general. </p>\n<p>From the New Wave perspective, there were certainly a lot of very interesting acts, but most were trying to exploit the new, cheaper synths of the time, and while I liked some electronic, it wasn't something I liked to deep dive into. Instead I was into the Pet Shop Boys, The Cure, Echo and The Bunnymen, REM, The Smiths, early U2, Tears for Fears, Midnight Oil, Talking Heads, X, The B-52's, Madness, Oingo Boingo, The English Beat, The Specials (yeah, I was into Ska) and others. </p>\n<p>One band that I liked but never seemed to get into, however, was XTC. How disappointing. </p>\n<p>In the last few years, I've been revisiting my foundations in 70's and 80's music and have started to re-collect some of the better stuff I was listening to back then. It's easy to get new copies of most of the stuff I used to listen to, though. It's not so easy to start digging into bands without knowing their albums, so I started poking around YouTube to refresh my memory. I've discovered an amazingly rich, eclectic, and forward-thinking band that could be easily placed in the same category as Talking Heads and other influential groups that started in the late 70's. Take this track from 1979 as an example...</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mfsYSPCNWCw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>1979? Really?! This is some tight alternative that sounds more at home in the late 80's, not early on in the 2nd British Invasion. Radio was really everything back then. I felt I was an adventurous musical soul. I was into progressive, new wave/alt, hard rock, heavy metal, jazz, jazz rock, funk, some punk (I loved X), some pop, and even some movie soundtracks. I bought albums, tapes and later CDs. Radio and friends, however, were the only real sources of what was coming out. Back then, kids didn't think about Rolling Stone magazine and the Internet wasn't even a dream. </p>\n<p>So, now I'm a couple of years away from turning 50, and I find out about XTC. </p>\n<p>Lucky me. Really :) Check out one more...</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"667\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZFCyMPvLd8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>1980. Yeah. Amazing. </p>\n</div>\n",
